      <p>The object of the present work is to identify the Hellenistic settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor and to gather information about their early history. A second volume will deal with Asia and North Africa. The basic organization of the book is by geographic areas—Thrace, the Islands, Mysia, etc. Within each area the colonies are ordered alphabetically. The entry for each foundation has two basic sections: narrative and annotation. In the narrative I attempt to identify the settlements, their founders, and location. I also try to present information about each settlement's early history and organization. The extended annotation is keyed to the narrative and provides detailed references, citations, and discussions for the material covered there. At the end of the work I have included a series of appendices that attempt to distill some of the information in the collected entries.</p>
      <p>When Victor Tscherikower wrote <i class="italic">Die hellenistischen Städtegründungen</i> he limited his study, as its title indicates, to city foundations. In my own enumeration I have tried to account for both the city foundations and the smaller, rural settlements. The evidence for the latter is limited primarily to western Asia Minor: settlements of the Macedonians, Jews, and Kardakians, among others, at various sites.</p>
      <p>I faced a problem when dealing with the numerous epigraphic references to <i class="italic">katoikiai, katoikoi</i> , etc. These inscriptions are all found in western Asia Minor. And practically all of them date from the Imperial period. Did these <i class="italic">katoikiai</i> originate as Hellenistic military colonies? B. Bar-Kochva, in his book <i class="italic">The Seleucid Army</i> (24ff.), claimed that the fact that the <i class="italic"> katoikiai</i> are confined to western Asia Minor shows they did begin as Hellenistic military colonies. I do not think this is correct. Certainly we would like to know why—if these <i class="italic"> katoikiai</i> began as Hellenistic colonies—it took over three hundred years before</p>

        <div class="page-number">xii</div>
        <hr id="JD_Page_xii"></div>
      <p>inscriptional evidence for over fifty of them suddenly began appearing in the first century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> and later. On this problem, I believe Louis Robert (<i class="italic">Études anatoliennes</i> , 191-94) has correctly defined the situation. The term <i class="italic">katoikos</i> does designate a military colonist of the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> in Ptolemaic Egypt. In western Asia Minor, however, the <i class="italic"> katoikiai</i> show no evidence of either a military organization or a Hellenistic origin. Inscriptions from the Hellenistic period that do record the existence of military colonies—that is, inscriptions mentioning Macedonians or <i class="italic">stratiotai</i> —do not normally use the term <i class="italic">katoikia</i> . In the Roman period the term is employed so loosely and vaguely, most often as the equivalent of <i class="italic">kome</i> , that one can conclude very little from the use of the term by itself. For this reason I usually do not include villages whose existence as <i class="italic">katoikiai</i> is attested solely by late inscriptional evidence.</p>
      <p>A comment about my treatment of some of the older, Greek cities that were simply renamed, often for a very short time. Since these cities were established and often were flourishing centers long before the advent of Alexander, I do not devote extensive attention to their organization and history in the Hellenistic period other than as regards changes or innovations related to the refounding.</p>
      <p>In its early stages I was privileged to discuss this work with my late advisor and friend, John V. A. Fine.</p>
      <p>While writing this book I have benefited from the advice and criticism of many friends. I am particularly grateful to Christian Habicht, Erich Gruen, Roger Bagnall, and Stanley Burstein, for their careful and judicious reading of my manuscript. In addition, Richard Billows, Eugene Borza, Thomas Drew-Bear, Clive Foss, Peter Herrmann, Arthur Houghton, Christopher Jones, Fred Kleiner, Stephen Mitchell, and the anonymous reader at the University of California Press made many helpful comments and criticisms. Of course I alone am responsible for any errors.</p>
      <p>I am grateful to Bill Nelson for his preparation of the maps. Mary Lamprech and Marian Rodgers have been a great help to me in converting manuscript to finished product.</p>
      <p>Randall Saunders helped with the preparation of the bibliography, Mischa Hooker and Philip Kennedy with the checking of footnotes and references. I am grateful to them, as I am to Jennifer Kingma for typing an early draft of this work.</p>
      <p>The transliteration of Greek personal and place-names is a perennial problem. Generally I have used the Greek spelling for the personal names of historical personages and town names but have relied on Latin usage for regional names and ancient authors. Depending upon the language in which he wrote, Elias Bickerman also spelled his surname Bickermann or Bikerman. In this volume I use the spelling Bickerman throughout.</p>

        <p>In 1927 Victor Tscherikower published <i class="italic">Die hellenistischen Städtegründungen</i> . Drawing on earlier investigations of J. G. Droysen (<i class="italic">Histoire de l'hellénisme</i> ), G. Radet (<i class="italic">De Coloniis a Macedonibus in Asiam Cis Taurum Deductis</i> ), and K. F. Hermann and H. Swoboda (<i class="italic">Griechische Staatsaltertümer</i>
          <sup class="superscript">6</sup> ), Tscherikower compiled a definitive list of the colonies of the Hellenistic world. This became and has remained the standard work for anyone interested in Hellenistic colonies. It is now over sixty years since the publication of Tscherikower's work. Much new information has come to light that renders Tscherikower's enumeration badly in need of revision. When he wrote his work in 1926, Tscherikower had 97 entries for Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor. The present study has over 180. The expansion of our knowledge of colonization can be seen both in the greater number of settlements and in the additional information that has surfaced for already attested foundations. For practically every entry in the present work some new piece of evidence has been discovered or some new interpretation has been suggested.</p>
        <p>For example, in 1968 Georges Le Rider demonstrated by a comparison of coin types that Rhithymna on Crete had been renamed ARSINOE. The presence of a Ptolemaic colony named PHILOTERA in Lycia was first discovered in 1979 with the publication of a fragmentary inscription from Telmessos that recorded a town of this name. The existence of EUKARPEIA in Phrygia has long been known from Strabo (12.8.13). But it was only in 1956 that two inscriptions—both from the early third century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> —provided the first evidence that there probably had been a military colony at Eukarpeia. These inscriptions (<i class="italic">SEG</i> XV.810, 812) mentioned offices and titles, including</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_2" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">2</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_2"></div>
        <p><i class="italic">klerouchos, stratiotes, bouleutes</i> , and <i class="italic"> eirenarches</i> . The first term, <i class="italic">klerouchos</i> , undoubtedly originated in a Hellenistic military colony and may be taken, I believe, as evidence that there had been a Hellenistic foundation at Eukarpeia.</p>
        <p>In other cases new information has subsequently—and dramatically— increased our knowledge about a particular site. Two examples from recent archaeological excavations illustrate the point. In discussing King Lysimachos' refounding of Ephesos as an ARSINOE, Strabo comments that the inhabitants were reluctant to move from the old city to the new site, but does not indicate why (14.1.21). In 1978 archaeologists digging at Ephesos found the remains of archaic graves in the agora of the new Hellenistic city. Undoubtedly the presence of graves at the new site was the reason the Ephesians did not want to move. At HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia inscriptions were found on the edges of seats in the theater and published in 1974. The inscriptions were from the Imperial period and recorded the names of the following tribes: Seleukis, Antiochis, Laodikis, Eumenis, Attalis, Stratonikis, and the <i class="italic"> prote phyle</i> of Apollonias. Prior to the discovery of these inscriptions there had been extensive discussion as to whether Hierapolis was a Seleucid or an Attalid foundation. The publication of these inscriptions firmly resolves the question in favor of the Seleucids.</p>
        <p>Newly discovered evidence can also allow us to remove a town from the ranks of Hellenistic settlements. This was the case for KADOI in Lydia. Prior to 1975 it had been claimed that Kadoi was a Macedonian colony. The evidence cited was Pliny <i class="italic">NH</i> 5.111: <i class="italic">Sardiana nunc appellatur ea iurisdictio, conveniuntque in eam extra praedictos Macedones Cadieni, Philadelphini etc</i> . In 1975 Christian Habicht published a Flavian <i class="italic">conventus</i> list from Ephesos that recorded a list of communities in the province of Asia. It mentioned the </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00026.gif"></figure>
         (I.1) and the 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00027.gif"></figure>
         (I.6) as separate entities. Hence, Habicht correctly suggested that in Pliny's list there has to be a comma after <i class="italic"> Macedones</i> in order to mark the separation from the following <i class="italic">Cadieni</i> and thus that Kadoi was not a Macedonian colony. Similarly, EUMENEIA in Caria was cited by Tscherikower as being among the Hellenistic foundations of that region. In 1935, however, Louis Robert demonstrated that a passage in Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.108) that served as one of the main buttresses for claiming Eumeneia as a Hellenistic colony was problematic, because at this point in his text Pliny had mistakenly inserted a group of Phrygian toponyms in his list of Carian cities. Hence we should remove Eumeneia from the Hellenistic foundations of Caria.
        <p></p>
        <p>ARSINOE in Cilicia had long been known from Strabo (14.5.3) and other later sources. But, other than its approximate location and the fact that Strabo says it had a landing place, not much was known about it. Then in 1989 E. Kirsten and I. Opelt published an inscription recording a letter from the <i class="italic">strategos</i> of Cilicia, Thraseas, to Arsinoe and a decree of Nagidos regarding</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_3" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">3</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_3"></div>
        <p>its relations with Arsinoe. The inscription provides detailed information about the founding and later embellishment of Arsinoe. This inscription is very important, both for the light it sheds on the political history of the Ptolemies overseas and for the information it provides about Ptolemaic colonization. It is in fact the first document to provide something more than a fragmentary picture of the organization of a Ptolemaic overseas settlement.</p>
        <p>These and other new discoveries and interpretations will be found in the scholarship on Hellenistic colonies of the last sixty years. In the present work I have taken account of these developments so as to identify those cities and towns that were Hellenistic foundations and refoundations and to gather information about their early history and organization.</p>
        <p>In the years since Tscherikower published his work, the study of the settlements has usually been undertaken as part of a larger investigation, either of a particular king or dynasty, region or topic. The Seleucid colonization program, not surprisingly, has received the most attention from scholars. E. Bickerman (<i class="italic">Institutions des Séleucides</i> , 1938), M. I. Rostovtzeff (<i class="italic">The Social and Economic History of the Hellenistic World</i> , 1941), W. W. Tarn (<i class="italic">The Greeks in Bactria and India</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 1951), D. Musti ("Lo stato dei Seleucidi," <i class="italic">SCO</i> 15 [1966] 61ff.), B. Bar-Kochva (<i class="italic">The Seleucid Army</i> , 1976), and G. M. Cohen (<i class="italic">The Seleucid Colonies</i> , 1978) all have devoted considerable attention to the Seleucid settlements. P. Briant ("Colonisation hellénistique et populations indigènes," <i class="italic">Klio</i> 60 [1978] 57ff.) and A. H. M. Jones (<i class="italic">The Greek City from Alexander to Justinian</i> , 1940) have had much to say about both the Seleucid and the other Hellenistic foundations.</p>
        <p>The colonizing activity of the various kings has been discussed by J. D. Grainger (<i class="italic">Seleukos Nikator</i> , 1990; <i class="italic">The Cities of Seleukid Syria</i> , 1990), W. Orth (<i class="italic">Königlicher Machtanspruch und städtische Freiheit</i> , 1977), H. H. Schmitt (<i class="italic">Untersuchungen zur Geschichte Antiochos' des Grossen und seiner Zeit</i> , 1964), and O. Mørkholm (<i class="italic">Antiochus IV of Syria</i> , 1966). R. A. Billows (<i class="italic">Antigonos the One-Eyed and the Creation of the Hellenistic State</i> , 1990), C. Wehrli (<i class="italic">Antigone et Démétrios</i> , 1968), and W. W. Tarn (<i class="italic">Antigonos Gonatas</i> , 1913) investigated the Antigonid settlements. The Attalid colonies have been studied by E. V. Hansen (<i class="italic">The Attalids of Pergamon</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 1971), R. E. Allen (<i class="italic">The Attalid Kingdom</i> , 1983), and J. Hopp (<i class="italic">Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der letzten Attaliden</i> , 1977). R. S. Bagnall (<i class="italic">The Administration of the Ptolemaic Possessions outside Egypt</i> , 1976), G. Longega (<i class="italic">Arsinoe II</i> , 1968), and W. Huss (<i class="italic">Untersuchungen zur Aussenpolitik Ptolemaios IV</i> , 1976) have investigated the Ptolemaic settlements.</p>
        <p>Regional studies often involve discussions of colonies. For example, N. G. L. Hammond, G. T. Griffith, and F. W. Walbank (<i class="italic">A History of Macedonia</i> , vols. 1-3, 1972-88), as well as F. Papazoglou (<i class="italic">Les villes de Macédoine à l'époque romaine</i> , 1988), should be consulted for settlements in Macedonia. M. Zahrnt (<i class="italic">Olynth und die Chalkidier</i> , 1971) is especially useful for Hellenistic settlements on the Chalcidic peninsula. For Asia Minor, D. Magie's <i class="italic">Roman Rule in Asia Minor</i></p>
        <div id="JD_Page_4" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">4</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_4"></div>
        <p>(1950) is particularly important. The discussions in volume I and the extended footnotes in volume 2 provide an excellent introduction to Hellenistic studies in that area. Louis Robert has written extensively and with great acumen on Asia Minor. His monographs and studies are resources of the utmost importance. For the Troad, for example, Robert's <i class="italic">Monnaies antiques en Troade</i> (1966) is especially useful, as is the survey of J. M. Cook (<i class="italic">The Troad</i> , 1973). For Caria, Louis and Jeanne Robert (<i class="italic">La Carie</i> , vol. 2, 1954; <i class="italic">nota bene</i> : vol. 1 was never published), A. Mastrocinque (<i class="italic">La Caria e la Ionia meridionale in epoca ellenistica</i> , 1979), and A. Laumonier (<i class="italic">Cultes indigènes en Carie</i> , 1958) provide an excellent introduction to the region and the settlements in it. D. R. Wilson (<i class="italic">The Historical Geography of Bithynia, Paphlagonia and Pontus in the Greek and Roman Periods</i> , 1960) and E. Olshausen and J. Biller (<i class="italic">Historisch-geographische Aspekte der Geschichte des pontischen und armenischen Reiches</i> , vol. 1, 1984) are important resources for northern Asia Minor, as are Robert (<i class="italic">À travers l'Asie Mineure</i> , 1980) and G. Vitucci (<i class="italic">Il regno di Bitinia</i> , 1953).</p>
        <p>In addition to regional studies, topical studies have also discussed settlements. Habicht, in his important <i class="italic">Gottmenschentum und griechische Städte</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> (1970), investigated civic cults in the early Hellenistic period and called attention to their appearance in Hellenistic colonies. W. Leschhorn (<i class="italic">Gründer der Stadt</i> , 1984) dealt with Hellenistic founders and the honors they received, while L. Boffo (<i class="italic">I re ellenistici e i centri religiosi dell' Asia Minore</i> , 1985) considered, among other things, the many sanctuaries in and near the Hellenistic settlements. Finally, a partial list of settlements can be found in many of the books I have already mentioned and in Jones's <i class="italic">Cities of the Eastern Roman Provinces</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> (1971).</p>

          <p>A problem facing the historian of Hellenistic Europe and Asia Minor is the fragmentary nature of the evidence.<a name="fnd0e2339-ref" href="#fnd0e2339" data-tei-tag="ref">1</a> The only continuous narrative of the period, that of Diodorus, stops abruptly just before the battle of Ipsos in 301 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> For the period following, the only continuous account is provided by Justin in his uneven epitome of Pompeius Trogus.

          <p>relied heavily on Polybius for the parts of his history that deal with affairs in Greece. In short, for the eastern Mediterranean in the third and second centuries <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> there is no extant continuous history. To compensate for this lacuna we must turn to other ancient authors and other sources of information. I have noted examples of archaeology adding to our knowledge of colonization; the epigraphic and numismatic sources also supply vital information. Before turning to these sources, however, I will discuss the literary evidence.</p>
          <p>Literary evidence for the Hellenistic settlements comes from both Greek and Roman as well as Byzantine sources. The geographic surveys of Strabo and Pliny and the <i class="italic">Geography</i> of Ptolemy are primary resources.</p>
          <p>Strabo (64/3 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> -21 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> ), who was from Amaseia in Pontus, wrote a <i class="italic">Geography</i> in seventeen books. Books 8-10 deal with Greece (largely antiquarian), 11 with the Euxine-Caspian region, and 12-14 with Asia Minor. Although he did travel (2.5.11), Strabo relied on the works of others for much of his information. Among these were Artemidorus of Ephesos (fl. 104 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ) and, for the Troad, Demetrius of Skepsis (early second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ). The latter wrote a learned geographical description of the Troad (in thirty books!) as a commentary on the Catalogue of Ships in the <i class="italic"> Iliad</i> . Strabo's primary strength and significance is as a historical rather than a physical geographer. His work is essentially an encyclopedia of historical geography. His account of a particular city will often give information about its location and the topography of the surrounding region, a brief historical outline, and descriptions of major monuments and religious sanctuaries as well as famous natives. In short, for an account of cities and towns, particularly in Asia Minor, Strabo is an important and authoritative source.</p>
          <p>Pliny the Elder (23/4-79 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> ) wrote a number of works of which only the <i class="italic">Natural History</i> survives. In thirty-seven books, it is an encyclopedia of scientific fields as diverse as botany and zoology, minerals and their use in medicine, art and architecture. Geography and ethnography are treated in books 3-6. If Strabo's <i class="italic">Geography</i> can be described as a historical geography, then these books of Pliny's <i class="italic">Natural History</i> can be described as an annotated list of cities and regions. Pliny normally follows a geographic order in enumerating cities and localities, often appending brief comments regarding their physical features. Although generally reliable, he occasionally gives erroneous information. I have already pointed out, for example, that at <i class="italic">NH</i> 5.108 he mistakenly inserted a group of Phrygian place-names in a list of Carian cities.</p>
          <p>Ptolemy's <i class="italic">Geography</i> is a bare list of places. Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus, fl. c. 140 <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span> ) was a geographer, mathematician, and astronomer. His <i class="italic">Geography</i> is a treatise in eight books whose purpose is to locate places by latitude and longitude on a map. Very rarely did Ptolemy add a historical or ethnographic note. Despite its great authority in antiquity and the Middle Ages, the <i class="italic"> Geography</i></p>
          <div id="JD_Page_6" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">6</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_6"></div>
          <p>has serious faults. For example, Ptolemy preferred Posidonius' estimate of 180,000 stades for the earth's circumference instead of the more nearly correct 250,000 stades posited by Eratosthenes. This, of course, skewed the distance between any two points of longitude. In a few cases he plotted the same town in two different places: thus he apparently gives Olba twice, in Cilicia and Cappadocia. Nevertheless, Ptolemy's <i class="italic">Geography</i> was and is an important geographical reference work and can be used for the relative location of sites in antiquity.</p>
          <p>In addition to the three geographers, a number of ancient historians and Plutarch appear with less frequency as sources of information. Polybius, Livy, Diodorus, and Pausanias all provide important details about colonization in Europe as well as Asia Minor. Both Appian (in his <i class="italic">Mithridatika</i> ) and Memnon provide evidence for Mithridates Eupator's activities. And last, Plutarch's fives of Alexander, Demetrios, Pyrrhos, and Lucullus contain important evidence.</p>
          <p>Because classical toponyms frequently appear in Byzantine literature, it is useful to consult the later geographers and the various episcopal city lists. As these authors and sources are possibly less well known than the classical authors, I provide brief notes about the more frequently cited sources.</p>
          <p>The best-known Byzantine antiquarian is, of course, Stephanos of Byzantion (fl. c. 528-535 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> ). His <i class="italic">Ethnika</i> , which survives in abridged form, is a fist of geographic names to which are appended items of historical or mythological interest. Stephanos' sources included Strabo and Pausanias. Despite the relative wealth of information he preserved, Stephanos must be consulted with caution: he frequently is confused or mistaken (see, for example, ANTIOCH on the Maeander and STRATONIKEIA in Lydia). Nevertheless, he often preserves information not found elsewhere and for this reason is an important, if erratic, source.</p>
          <p>The <i class="italic">Tabula Peutingeriana</i> is a twelfth- or early-thirteenth-century map based on a fifth-century copy that may ultimately have been derived from a map prepared by Marcus Agrippa. It is twenty-one feet long and one foot wide, depicting the known world from the tip of England to India and Ceylon. The segment comprising the British Isles and the Iberian peninsula is lost. The map is well illustrated with pictures of cities, baths, temples, and harbors, among other things. It also indicates the roads and stations that were used by the Roman postal service.<a name="fnd0e2447-ref" href="#fnd0e2447" data-tei-tag="ref">2</a> Distances between stations are given, but these are</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_7" class="page-break-container">

            <hr id="JD_Page_7"></div>
          <p>not always correct. W. K. Pritchett was critical, for example, of the section from Pella to Larisa in Europe. W. M. Ramsay concluded that the map was untrustworthy for central and eastern Asia Minor but was "much freer from error in the western and especially the southwestern part of the country."<a name="fnd0e2536-ref" href="#fnd0e2536" data-tei-tag="ref">3</a></p>
          <p>Hierokles is the (presumed) author of a list of cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, the <i class="italic">Synekdemos</i> .<a name="fnd0e2555-ref" href="#fnd0e2555" data-tei-tag="ref">4</a> It is dated before 535 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> Normally it is arranged by provinces, with the cities in each province given in geographic order. Lydian cities, however, are listed in hierarchic order. The title suggests that the work was probably intended to be some kind of guidebook. Despite errors and omissions it is an important source for Byzantine geography. Undoubtedly it owes its preservation to the fact that it and the <i class="italic">Description</i> of George of Cyprus were mistaken for episcopal <i class="italic">notitiae</i> .</p>
          <p>The Geographer of Ravenna is an anonymous author of the early eighth century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> His <i class="italic"> Cosmography</i> gives over five thousand toponyms along with lists of rivers and islands. It is possible that the Ravenna Geographer copied his place-names from the same source as the <i class="italic">Tabula Peutingeriana</i> . His knowledge of prior geographers is weak. His list of place-names is random, with no discernible order; furthermore he sometimes mistakenly lists a river as a place-name. Despite this and despite corruption in the text, O. A. W. Dilke suggests that the <i class="italic">Cosmography</i> is "a source of valuable information which can supplement that from earlier sources."<a name="fnd0e2570-ref" href="#fnd0e2570" data-tei-tag="ref">5</a></p>
          <p>The <i class="italic">Notitiae Episcopatuum</i> are lists of ecclesiastical dioceses. The earliest extant <i class="italic">notitia</i> from Constantinople dates from the early seventh century <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span> , the latest from the Turkish period. The purpose of the <i class="italic">Notitiae</i> was primarily to indicate the rank and honor of the various church officials and their sees. In the <i class="italic">Notitiae</i> metropolitan sees are given first, followed by autonomous archbishoprics and, lastly, bishoprics. A group of bishoprics made up a metropolis. The basis of the arrangement of the bishoprics was hierarchic rather than geographic. But what the principle of order was is not dear. According to Ramsay, "there are difficulties in the supposition that the Notitiae arrange the</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_8" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">8</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_8"></div>
          <p>Bishoprics in order of dignity and precedence.... Importance, wealth, historical prestige, locality might exercise some influence: local proximity formed in some cases a cause of enumerating several Bishops together, placing first that which was most important either for wealth and for historical reasons."<a name="fnd0e2601-ref" href="#fnd0e2601" data-tei-tag="ref">6</a> At the very least, however, the presence of a bishopric in a particular province does provide some indication of general location. Finally, I would mention the <i class="italic"> Tabula Imperii Byzantini</i> , a particularly thorough modern compendium of information on Byzantine geography.</p>
          <p>As useful as the literary sources are, they do have certain limitations. For locating cities the various Byzantine lists are helpful only to the degree that they follow a geographic rather than a hierarchic or random order. The ancient historians generally give information about colonies only in passing. They are usually interested in other events and mention a particular city or town only because something happened there. Occasionally, however, they do give substantive information. Thus Plutarch in his life of Demetrios provides important information about the refounding and enhancement of Sikyon as a Demetrias. Appian and Livy both supply useful information about Antiochos III's refounding of Lysimacheia in Thrace. And Appian in his <i class="italic">Syriaka</i> (57) gives a biographical sketch of Seleukos I in the course of which he lists the king's settlements. But these are exceptions. If the historians were, understandably, not primarily interested in cities and settlements, Strabo—a geographer—was. I have already discussed briefly Strabo's importance for the information about settlements that he does give us. But it is also necessary to bear in mind what he and the other geographers and historians do <i class="italic"> not</i> give us: information about the political, constitutional, and certain of the religious institutions of the various cities. Either because he was not interested or, more probably, because he assumed his readers either knew or were themselves not interested, Strabo says little about these matters. For information on these institutions we must turn to the inscriptions.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="d0e587" data-tei-tag="div3" data-type="ss2">
          <h3 class="Heading-Heading4"><a href="#d0e587" class="heading-link">Inscriptions</a></h3>
          <p>Inscriptions have the great advantage of usually being contemporary with the event they commemorate and of being official records. Of course as official documents they may also be propaganda vehicles. Furthermore inscriptions are often incomplete and fragmentary, are frequently difficult to date precisely,</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_9" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">9</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_9"></div>
          <p>and may not have been found <i class="italic">in situ</i> . In addition we may often owe to chance the survival and discovery of an inscription. Nevertheless inscriptions are sources of evidence of the highest importance and, in the case of the Hellenistic settlements, provide us with vital information not available elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Inscriptions, for example, often record decrees of cities, and these decrees frequently supply important information about the constitutional apparatus: the magistracies, the council and assembly, the dating formula, tribal and month names, institutions such as the gymnasium and the <i class="italic">ephebeia</i> and the various officials connected with each. Inscriptions provide evidence for citizens of a particular city being invited to settle lawsuits in other cities and acting as judges in international disputes as well as being appointed <i class="italic">proxenoi</i> and winning races in international competitions. Inscriptions also record treaties and communications between cities, such as exchanges of <i class="italic"> isopoliteia</i> (grants of potential citizenship to citizens of another city) and recognition of <i class="italic">asylia</i> (freedom from reprisal and the right of receiving suppliants), as well as royal letters to cities.</p>
          <p>Epigraphic evidence is our primary source of information for both honorific decrees and civic and dynastic cults. In addition, decrees and other inscribed materials with toponyms or ethnics can, if found <i class="italic">in situ</i> , help fix the location of cities. Thus the location of ANTIGONEIA in Epirus, long a matter of dispute, was settled with the recent discovery at a place overlooking the Drin River of bronze discs with the inscription ANTI<span class="Symbol">G</span> ONE<span class="Symbol">W</span> N.</p>
          <p>The epigraphic evidence is obviously very valuable. Where it can be firmly dated and ascribed to a particular city it can provide us with contemporary and official documentation on the activities, the organization, and the administration of that city. All our literary sources with the exception of Polybius lived long after the Hellenistic period and were generally not interested in the organization and administration of cities and settlements. Even Strabo, who focuses on regions and cities, is not primarily interested in constitutional questions. In short, if it were not for the inscriptional evidence, we would have very little information regarding the way the settlements governed and managed themselves and the way they related to other cities and to the kings. APOLLONIA Salbake may serve as a good example of how informative the epigraphic evidence can be. The existence of Apollonia was always known from Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.109) and citations in Ptolemy and Hierokles. This was, however, essentially all that was known about Apollonia until the appearance of various inscriptions, all published within the last sixty years. A fragmentary inscription dated to the nineteenth year of the Seleucid era in the month of Panemos (June 243 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ) mentions "King Seleukos" and records the opening of a decree of the assembly. Another inscription, probably from the time of Antiochos III, mentions a council and assembly that granted, among other</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_10" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">10</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_10"></div>
          <p>things, citizenship rights, <i class="italic">ateleia</i> , and <i class="italic">proedria</i> to the Seleucid hipparch stationed there. Obviously there was a Seleucid garrison at Apollonia at this time. The inhabitants also celebrated a gymnastic <i class="italic">agon</i> in honor of "King Seleukos." This is probably Seleukos I, and we are undoubtedly dealing with a city-founder cult. We also learn that in the vicinity of Apollonia there were "sacred villages" and a population, the Saleioi of the mountain and of the plain, who belonged to the sanctuary.</p>
          <p>Since 1927 the study of Hellenistic inscriptions has been greatly facilitated by the appearance of a number of publications and publication series. The continuing fascicles of the <i class="italic">Tituli Asiae Minoris</i> as well as volumes of the <i class="italic">Monumenta Asiae Minoris Antiqua</i> , the <i class="italic">Inschriften griechischer Städte aus Kleinasien</i> , and G. Dagron and D. Feissel's <i class="italic">Inscriptions de Cilicie</i> are all vital resources for Asia Minor, as are the results of the epigraphic journeys of, among others, P. Herrmann, G. E. Bean and T. B. Mitford, and T. Drew-Bear. For THESSALONIKE the <i class="italic">Inscriptiones Graecae</i> , X.2, fasc. 1, <i class="italic">Inscriptiones Thessalonicae et Viciniae</i> , is of great importance. The publication of many new inscriptions since the appearance of Welles's <i class="italic">Royal Correspondence in the Hellenistic Period</i> renders it in need of revision. Nevertheless it remains an important and useful collection. Another important collection is H. H. Schmitt, <i class="italic">Die Staatsverträge des Altertums</i> III. Both the <i class="italic">Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum</i> and the "Bulletin épigraphique" published regularly in the <i class="italic">Revue des études grecques</i> by Jeanne and Louis Robert for so many years, and now continued by a group of scholars, are essential tools for keeping abreast of progress in epigraphy. The latter frequently contains incisive comments on numismatics as well.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="d0e695" data-tei-tag="div3" data-type="ss2">
          <h3 class="Heading-Heading4"><a href="#d0e695" class="heading-link">Coins</a></h3>
          <p>It is possible to distinguish at least five categories for coins of the Hellenistic period: <i class="italic">(a)</i> royal coins issued by the kings at their own mints, <i class="italic">(b)</i> coins minted for the kings by cities under their control, <i class="italic">(c)</i> cistophoric coinage issued under royal Attalid supervision in the name of certain cities of western Asia Minor, <i class="italic">(d)</i> civic or autonomous coins issued by the cities for their own use, and <i class="italic">(e)</i> hybrid coins found especially in the reign of Antiochos IV Epiphanes minted by cities with the name of the issuing city on the reverse and a portrait of the king on the obverse.</p>
          <p>The civic coins were normally minted in bronze, though some silver issues were also produced, and were intended for local circulation. Thus when Antiochos VII gave Simon the high priest in Jerusalem the right to coin money he specified that it was to be used locally (1 Macc. 15.6). In a study of the Hellenistic foundations we are primarily concerned with the civic rather than the royal coins. And in dealing with these coins one should bear in mind their</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_11" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">11</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_11"></div>
          <p>limitations—and potential—as evidence for the various settlements. In the first place the dating of these coins is extremely difficult. With the exception of the occasional appearance of a magistrate's name, the civic coinage normally does not carry any explicit indication of date. Hence the dating often is based on factors such as hoard evidence, die linkage, or historical context. These factors, however useful, cannot be substituted for historical evidence unless they are, in turn, anchored in a firmly datable event or personage. It is important to emphasize this because numismatists and historians frequently tend to assume that numismatic "events"—for example, the appearance of a new weight system, new coin types, etc.—are tied to historical events. In many cases this may be true, but it is not a certainty; in short, it is an axiom, not a proven theorem.</p>
          <p>In the second place the attribution of coins can change. A change in attribution can result from the study of such factors as monograms, coin types, or magistrates' names. Thus in 1979 Mørkholm suggested that cistophori with the monogram </p>
          <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00028.gif"></figure>
           belonged not with APAMEIA Kelainai but with either Parion in the Hellespont or Apollonia on the Rhyndakos. More recently, however, R. Bauslaugh and Le Rider have argued convincingly that the original attribution to Apameia is to be preferred. And while coins of an Antioch with a Maeander River symbol can confidently be assigned to ANTIOCH on the Maeander, other Antioch coins have been attributed and reattributed to ANTIOCH Alabanda, Kebren, in Mysia, and near Pisidia. Furthermore coins of Arsinoe have been reassigned to and from ARSINOE Lyktou, Rhithymna, and Methana, while reattributions have occurred for the various APOLLONIAS (Salbake, on the Maeander, in Phrygia, and on the Rhyndakos) as well as for PTOLEMAIS Larisa, Lebedos, in Caria, and in Pamphylia.
          <p></p>
          <p>If the attribution and reattribution of coins to cities is sometimes frustrating, at other times it has resulted in the identification and location of a number of Hellenistic settlements. I have already mentioned that the refounding of Rhithymna as an ARSINOE is known only from the numismatic evidence. The same is also true for, among other cities, EURYDIKEIA (Smyrna), ANTIOCH on the Saros (Adana), and SELEUKEIA on the Pyramos (Mopsuestia). In these cases the identification was initially made by comparing the coin types of issues bearing the name of the Hellenistic foundations with those of the native city. In other instances the combined evidence of epigraphic and numismatic sources has also yielded identifications. For example, we learn from inscriptions and coins that Lebedos was refounded as a PTOLEMAIS, that APOLLONIA was an earlier name of Tripolis in Lydia, and that PHILADELPHEIA in Lydia, itself a Hellenistic settlement, was later refounded as Neocaesarea.</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_12" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">12</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_12"></div>
          <p>As with epigraphy, the study of numismatics as it relates to the Hellenistic settlements has made great strides in the last sixty years. Of particular interest are two great collections of the <i class="italic"> Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum</i> (<i class="italic">SNG</i> )—that of the Danish National Museum, Copenhagen, and that of Hans von Aulock. In addition the collection in R. Ziegler's <i class="italic">Münzen Kilikiens aus kleineren deutschen Sammlungen</i> (1988) and the Tübingen and Switzerland <i class="italic">SNG</i> volumes, to name just a few, are quite useful. E. T. Newell's <i class="italic">Western Seleucid Mints</i> and A. Houghton's <i class="italic">Coins of the Seleucid Empire</i> are concerned with the issues of royal mints. They and Le Rider, among others, have made major contributions to Hellenistic numismatics. In addition, von Aulock has concentrated on the cities of Phrygia, Lycaonia, and Pisidia in three volumes. Louis Robert has focused on numismatics in a number of studies, and Mørkholm, in numerous articles, longer investigations, and, most recently, in his posthumous <i class="italic"> Early Hellenistic Coinage</i> , has made major contributions to Hellenistic numismatics. The regional reviews of numismatic literature begun in the <i class="italic">Jahrbuch für Numismatik und Geldgeschichte</i> in 1955 and continued in <i class="italic">Chiron</i> in 1972 are particularly helpful, as is <i class="italic">Numismatic Literature</i> , which, since 1949, has provided a useful listing with brief summaries of published work.</p>

          <h3 class="Heading-Heading4"><a href="#d0e759" class="heading-link">Archaeology</a></h3>
          <p>It hardly needs to be said that the study of Hellenistic foundations has been immeasurably helped by archaeology. Our knowledge of Hellenistic city planning, for example, has been expanded tremendously by the results of excavations. One thinks immediately of PRIENE; another particularly fruitful excavation has been that at DEMETRIAS in Thessaly.</p>
          <p>Excavations have occasionally provided solutions to previously unanswerable historical questions. I have already mentioned the reluctance of the Ephesians to move to the new site of ARSINOE chosen by Lysimachos and the solution to this problem that was offered by archaeology. I would also recall that the question whether HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia was a Seleucid or an Attalid settlement was finally settled by the discovery of inscribed theater seats that first came to light in the course of excavation. The mention of the inscribed theater seats at Hierapolis brings us back to the epigraphic and numismatic evidence, for it is frequently archaeological excavations that have yielded the inscriptions and coins that play such an important role in allowing us to reconstruct the history of a particular town.</p>
          <p>To keep abreast of progress in archaeology one may turn to a number of sources. The <i class="italic">Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites</i> , published in 1976, is a useful compendium of information on the major towns and cities.

          <p>particularly valuable resource. For Greece one may also consult the "Archaeological Reports" in the <i class="italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies</i> , as well as the "Chronique des fouilles et découvertes archéologiques en Grèce" in the <i class="italic">Bulletin de correspondance hellénique</i> . For Asia Minor one should consult the "Newsletter" from Asia Minor published for many years by Machteld Mellink in the <i class="italic">American Journal of Archaeology</i> and "Recent Archaeological Research in Turkey" in <i class="italic">Anatolian Studies</i> . For Cyprus the "Chronique des fouilles ... à Chypre," also in the <i class="italic">Bulletin de correspondance hellénique</i> , is very useful, as is the <i class="italic">Annual Report of the Department of Antiquities</i> .</p>

        <p>Alexander the Great changed the face of the Middle East. He came to the throne in 336 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , invaded the Persian Empire two years later, and by the time he died in 323 had completely overrun the kingdom of Darius III. In so doing he brought under his control most of the Middle East as well as parts of central Asia and northern India, thus opening up a new world to the Macedonians and Greeks. Clearly it was necessary to establish a presence as visible and strong as possible. One means of exerting control was to settle retired Macedonian and Greek soldiers at various strategic points. Practically all of Alexander's colonies were in the East, in areas beyond the purview of this volume. Nevertheless, because of Alexander's influence on the Hellenistic world in general and Hellenistic colonization in particular, it is useful to discuss briefly his role as a colonizer and the background to his colonizing activities.</p>
        <p>The antecedents to Alexander's settlement program are complex. They can be found in both Europe and the Middle East. In the <i class="italic"> Philip</i> (120), written in 346 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> , Isocrates had addressed the problem of the unemployed in Greece and had suggested to Philip II that he conquer Asia Minor, found new cities along the border areas, and settle in them those unemployed at the time in Greece. They would serve, in Isocrates' words, as a "buffer" vis-à-vis the Persians. At the same time, Philip would solve a major social problem facing fourth-century Greece.<a name="fnd0e2848-ref" href="#fnd0e2848" data-tei-tag="ref">1</a> As precedents for this great colonization scheme Isocrates</p>

        <p>could consider the Greek colonies sent out earlier in the eighth and seventh centuries <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and the cleruchies and colonies established by the Athenians in their fifth-century empire. There were also precedents in the East: the population transfers practiced by the Persians and earlier by the Babylonians and Assyrians.<a name="fnd0e2901-ref" href="#fnd0e2901" data-tei-tag="ref">2</a> When the Persians conquered Asia Minor they dealt with security problems by transferring dissidents to remote parts of their empire. The Eretrians and the Milesians, for example, were deported to Susiana and the Red Sea coast, respectively.<a name="fnd0e2926-ref" href="#fnd0e2926" data-tei-tag="ref">3</a></p>
        <p>Philip used population transfer and colonization as part of his program to pacify and control areas under his rule. Justin provides the clearest statement of this policy: "Returning to his kingdom, as shepherds move their flocks now to winter, now to summer pastures, so he [Philip] transported people and cities, according to his whim, as places appeared to him to need to be restored or abandoned.... Some people he installed on the frontiers against his enemies, others he placed in the most remote parts of his kingdom; some whom he had taken prisoner he distributed to supplement the populations of the cities. And thus from many tribes and nations he established one kingdom and people" (8.5.7-6.2).</p>
        <p>Beginning with the refounding of Krenides in Thrace as Philippoi in 356 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , Philip followed a policy of "founding strong cities at important places" in order to gain control of the Thracians (Diod. 16.71.1-2).<a name="fnd0e2930-ref" href="#fnd0e2930" data-tei-tag="ref">4</a> Some</p>

        <p>of Philip's colonies involved the movement of (unwilling) Macedonians to new centers. Other transfers were overtly punitive. Thus, after bringing the Sarmisii under his control, Philip "led them off to Macedonia, ten thousand of them" (Polyaenus 4.2.12). We may note, too, the case of Philippopolis in Thrace. According to Theopompus (<i class="italic">FGrH</i> 115 F110) Philip established this city, nicknamed "Poneropolis," by populating it with criminals, sycophants, and false witnesses. Allowing for hyperbole, Theopompus' remarks suggest that the establishment of the city was intended to deal with social problems elsewhere. Of course this was precisely the kind of program Isocrates was recommending for ridding Greece of <i class="italic">its</i> social ills.</p>
        <p>In his colonization program, as in so much else, Alexander was influenced by Philip.<a name="fnd0e3001-ref" href="#fnd0e3001" data-tei-tag="ref">5</a> But the situation facing Alexander was quite different from that which had confronted Philip. Not surprisingly Alexander's response differed in significant ways from his father's. Alexander's conquests took him thousands of miles from Macedonia. This distance from his homeland undoubtedly influenced both the policy he adopted toward the native populations he conquered and his colonization program. Given the vastness of his empire and the distance from Macedonia it made eminently good sense to avoid antagonizing his new subjects. As a matter of policy Alexander tried to cultivate the acquiescence and loyalty of the people he conquered. The difficulties in pacifying the eastern regions of his new empire made clear the need to foster such loyalty. The many anecdotes relating to Alexander's beneficent interest in the new <i class="italic">ethne</i> he met and conquered attest not only to his tremendous curiosity but also to his skill as diplomat, politician, and strategist. Unlike his predecessors in the Middle East and Macedonia, he apparently avoided where possible the use of punitive deportations.<a name="fnd0e3014-ref" href="#fnd0e3014" data-tei-tag="ref">6</a></p>
        <p>Just as distance from Europe affected the way Alexander treated the Asiatics, so it influenced his colonization program. It was one thing to move Macedonians from the interior to the border regions of Macedonia; it was quite another matter to move them from Macedonia to areas east of Mesopotamia. Although Alexander could bring over recruits for his army when he needed</p>

        <p>them, he could not simply move Macedonian civilians to new colonies as his father had done. It made better sense, logistically, to use retired soldiers as colonists. They were, after all, in the area, and they were of proven loyalty. It was, however, more than distance that prevented Alexander from bringing over Macedonian civilians for his new settlements: in his short life Alexander was constantly preoccupied with the conquest and pacification of his new empire. Diodorus claims that among the <i class="italic"> hypomnemata</i> found after Alexander's death, one item indicated that he had planned "to found cities and to transfer populations from Asia to Europe and in the opposite direction from Europe to Asia in order to bring the largest continents to community and to the friendship of kinsmen by intermarriage and friendly ties" (18.4.4).<a name="fnd0e3041-ref" href="#fnd0e3041" data-tei-tag="ref">7</a> Irrespective of whether this controversial document is authentic or not, it is conceivable that under peaceful conditions Alexander would have wanted to undertake such a program. But the distances involved would have made the enterprise daunting even under the best of circumstances. We know from at least one other source that it was quite difficult to transplant settlers. When Antiochos III moved the two thousand Jewish families from Mesopotamia and Babylonia to Lydia and Phrygia he specifically alluded to the fact that the move would be difficult (</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00029.gif"></figure>
         (Joseph. <i class="italic">AJ</i> 12.150). Presumably, the king was referring to logistical problems or the reluctance of the Jews to go. Alexander would have faced the same difficulties bringing civilian settlers from Europe to regions east of the Tigris. It will not be surprising therefore if Alexander, preoccupied as he was by military operations and security concerns, did not undertake any population transfer of this type. In fact he did not have to do this because he had already effected a population transfer of far greater proportions by virtue of the Greek and Macedonian soldiers who had followed him and whom he continued to bring to Asia. These were the ones he settled in his colonies. Alexander's colonizing activity corresponded to the advice Isocrates gave Philip, but not in the region the orator had suggested. The latter, of course, was thinking of Asia Minor. By the time Alexander implemented his own colonization program he had moved well beyond Asia Minor. I have already mentioned that nearly all of Alexander's colonies were east of the Tigris. W. W. Tarn believes that "the reason is obvious." As he explains it, "between the Aegean and the Tigris he had plenty of existing cities, Greek, Phoenician, Syrian, Babylonian; between the Tigris and India hardly a couple."<a name="fnd0e3054-ref" href="#fnd0e3054" data-tei-tag="ref">8</a> Tarn is quite correct about the relative scarcity of

        <p>cities east of the Tigris. But geographic determinism is hardly the whole explanation. After all, the Seleucids later ruled vast stretches of territory in both Asia and Asia Minor and found occasion to establish settlements throughout their empire, both west and east of the Tigris.</p>
        <p>It was after his second great victory over the Persians, at Issos in 333 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , that Alexander began founding settlements. The battle of Issos represents a major turning point in Alexander's march of conquest. Up to this time he could claim recognition as King of Macedonia and Hegemon of the League of Corinth. In his initial correspondence with King Darius after Issos Alexander rehearsed Darius' "crimes" and ordered that in future he was to be addressed as "King of Asia" (Arr. <i class="italic"> Anab</i> . 2.14.9). Of course Alexander had not yet conquered all of Asia. But the vigorous self-confidence in the claim to the title translated itself into action. It was now, as claimant to the rule of Asia, that Alexander began building settlements. And just as his father had founded eponymous cities, so he founded Alexandreia in Egypt, the first of many settlements with that name.<a name="fnd0e3081-ref" href="#fnd0e3081" data-tei-tag="ref">9</a> What began after Issos when Alexander called himself de facto "King of Asia" continued after Gaugamela and the death of Darius when de jure he became "King of Asia." Alexander's treatment of Ilion may serve as one example of the new situation created by the conquest of the Persian Empire. According to Strabo (13.1.26), immediately after the battle of the Granikos River in 334 Alexander made various benefactions to Ilion (on which see below). But it was only after the "overthrow of the Persians" that Alexander wrote to Ilion and promised to make it a "great city." Not surprisingly, it was also after the "overthrow of the Persians," when Alexander was transformed from conqueror to ruler, that he began in earnest to found settlements throughout his newly won kingdom.</p>
        <p>Every colony served some specific purpose—be it to pacify an area, guard a road, or garrison a frontier region. And practically every colony had the same official name, Alexandreia. The use of this toponym was a master stroke of propaganda. It served as a constant reminder to the inhabitants of the particular region of the royal presence, and it bound the colonists more closely to the king. Of course, it also served as a reminder of the greatness and extent of Alexander's power. Not surprisingly, Alexander's successors made extensive use of family eponyms when founding their settlements.</p>
        <p>Alexander's influence on the age that followed his reign cannot be overstated. He not only brought the whole Persian Empire under Greco-</p>

        <p>Macedonian rule and bequeathed it to his successors; he also established the model for Hellenistic kingship. And one of the activities a Hellenistic king undertook was the establishment of new settlements. While the Successors were emulating Alexander they were incidentally competing with each other. And just as Alexander founded settlements throughout his empire, so his successors did likewise in the kingdoms they inherited. In the generation after Alexander's death there was a very strong tendency for all the Successors to act in unison. What one did, all did; what one avoided, all avoided. In 306, for example, after the battle of Salamis, Antigonos and Demetrios assumed the title "king." Not to be outdone, the other Diadochoi "out of jealousy" (</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00030.gif"></figure>
        , Diod. 20.53.4) similarly took the title at this time. A consideration of the marriages contracted by the various Diadochoi reveals the same tendency. In the years before the battle of Ipsos they avoided marriages with each other. Immediately after, with the changed international situation brought about by the death of Antigonos and the disintegration of his empire, the Diadochoi ventured into a veritable frenzy of marriages. Seleukos married Demetrios' daughter Stratonike; Ptolemy gave one daughter, Arsinoe, to Lysimachos, another daughter, Theoxena, to Agathokles of Syracuse, a third, Ptolemais, to Demetrios, and a fourth, Lysandra, to Kassandros' son Alexander. Meanwhile another son of Kassandros, Antipater, married Lysimachos' daughter, Eurydike, and Pyrrhos married Antigone, Berenike's daughter by Philippos.<a name="fnd0e3109-ref" href="#fnd0e3109" data-tei-tag="ref">10</a>
        <p></p>
        <p>It comes as no surprise then that all the Diadochoi founded settlements. The earliest, incidentally, were established even before the Successors took the title of "king." Kassandros was apparently the first, building KASSANDREIA and probably THESSALONIKE as well, in 316 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> The latter toponym is interesting. Kassandros named the settlement, of course, in honor of his wife, who was a daughter of Philip II. As a claimant to the Macedonian throne he was surely aware of the propaganda value of following the lead of Philip and Alexander in founding cities and then advertising his tie to them by the name of one of his cities.<a name="fnd0e3122-ref" href="#fnd0e3122" data-tei-tag="ref">11</a> In 316 Kassandros also rebuilt Boeotian THEBES, which had been destroyed by Alexander the Great, and shortly after encouraged Acarnanians to move from their unfortified villages to larger, protected cities (Diod. 19.67.4). Lysimachos founded LYSIMACHEIA in 309, and Antigonos in the years before his death at Ipsos had an active career as a colonizer.</p>

          <hr id="JD_Page_21"></div>
        <p>The royal tradition of settlement founding and refounding continued with succeeding generations. However, it was more than just tradition that impelled Hellenistic monarchs and dynasts to found colonies.<a name="fnd0e3152-ref" href="#fnd0e3152" data-tei-tag="ref">12</a> Colonization programs answered military and security, as well as economic and political, needs (see below, "The Purpose of the Settlements"). It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the successors of the Diadochoi also founded large numbers of settlements.</p>
        <p>Discussions of colonization by Alexander's successors tend to concentrate on the Seleucid achievements.<a name="fnd0e3156-ref" href="#fnd0e3156" data-tei-tag="ref">13</a> This is understandable. The Seleucid empire was vast, by far the largest of the successor states. And the Seleucids, especially Seleukos I as well as Antiochos I and II, were vigorous colonizers. But they were not the only Hellenistic rulers to found colonies. As I have already mentioned, Antigonos I Monophthalmos was also an energetic builder. It is well to recall for example that at least three major Hellenistic foundations—ALEXANDREIA Troas, NIKAIA, and Antioch on the Orontes—had originally been founded as Antigoneias. And in fact a number of scholars have argued that Antigonos effectively anticipated much of the great colonizing work of Seleukos.<a name="fnd0e3163-ref" href="#fnd0e3163" data-tei-tag="ref">14</a> Antigonos' successors, especially Demetrios Poliorketes and Philip V, continued the pattern he set. More or less contemporary with Antigonos Monophthalmos were Kassandros and Lysimachos, both of whom took an active role in founding settlements. I have already referred to Kassandros' foundations. Lysimachos' settlements included LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, ALEXANDREIA Troas, NIKAIA, ARSINOE Ephesos, and EURYDIKEIA Smyrna. The Attalids, of course, established colonies in the area they ruled.<a name="fnd0e3176-ref" href="#fnd0e3176" data-tei-tag="ref">15</a> Their foundations included STRATONIKEIA (possibly) and PHILADELPHEIA in Lydia, DIONYSOPOLIS and EUMENEIA in Phrygia, and ATTALEIA in Pamphylia. Reflecting their strength as a naval power, the Ptolemies established numerous colonies in harbors and port cities throughout the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean.<a name="fnd0e3185-ref" href="#fnd0e3185" data-tei-tag="ref">16</a> It was not, however, just the successor kings to Alexander who were colonizers. Lesser known dynasts, such as Pleistarchos and the Lysias/Philomelos family established colonies, as did the Bithynian, Pontic, and other semi-Hellenized kings. In short, settlement</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_22" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">22</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_22"></div>
        <p>founding was actively and widely pursued by all the Hellenistic kings and dynasts.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that the earliest datable settlements of the Successors were in Europe, not Asia Minor or Asia, and they did not involve population transfer. Rather, both KASSANDREIA and THESSALONIKE as well as LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace resulted from synoecism, a traditional Greek method for founding poleis and one that was subsequently widely used in Asia Minor by other monarchs. Frequently ancient authors will specify that a particular place had resulted from a synoecism. Similarly inscriptions will occasionally make reference to a <i class="italic">synoikismos</i> . It is well to recall, therefore, that the term could be used to describe a number of different processes. For example, it could refer to the political unification of various towns with or without the inhabitants actually moving. In other cases it could be used to describe the repopulation of a city with former inhabitants who had scattered or fled.<a name="fnd0e3225-ref" href="#fnd0e3225" data-tei-tag="ref">17</a></p>
        <p>These early settlements were founded, as I have said, in the late fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> The time frame for Hellenistic colony foundings runs from this point to the beginning of the first century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Within that period each of the dynasties was active at particular times. Antigonid colonizing began at the end of the fourth century with Antigonos Monophthalmos and continued at a slower pace under his successors down to Philip V. The great age of Seleucid colonization also began at the end of the fourth century and extended to the middle of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> —the period coterminous with the greatest vigor and stability of the family. Certainly Seleucid kings founded settlements after this time, but the number of new colonies declined and the nature of the undertaking changed. For example, we can ascribe definitely or tentatively—at least thirteen settlements in Asia Minor to Antiochos I. The available evidence indicates that many of these were settled by Macedonians or Greeks. In contrast, we can credit Antiochos III with only five. At LYSIMACHEIA he did undertake a major program to rebuild a city that had been destroyed and abandoned. On the other hand, at SARDIS and AMYZON his work was limited to urban rehabilitation. Finally, for two, the JEWISH COLONIES in Lydia and Phrygia and the KARDAKIAN KOME in Lycia (possibly a colony of his), Antiochos HI used Asiatics. Antiochos IV probably founded fewer colonies than has generally been believed. And those foundations that may be ascribed to him were in all likelihood little more than formal renamings.<a name="fnd0e3229-ref" href="#fnd0e3229" data-tei-tag="ref">18</a> The bulk of Ptolemaic colonizing activity took place in the first half of the</p>

        <p>third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , especially during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphos (285-246). Not surprisingly, the lesser Hellenistic dynasties that first appeared on the international stage in the generations after the Diadochoi were active somewhat later. Thus we find the Attalids as well as the Bithynian and Cappadocian royal houses undertaking energetic settlement founding programs in the latter part of the third and the first half of the second century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> Last of all, the Pontic dynasty, particularly Mithridates VI Eupator, was responsible for a number of foundations.</p>

        <p>In the Hellenistic period the center of gravity of the Greek world shifted from Greece to the Middle East. By the end of the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Sparta was already in decline, Thebes had had its brief moment in the sun, and Athens after the Lamian War moved swiftly off the center stage. In the generation that followed, Athens became what it would remain until the end of antiquity: a respected university town, visited by persons of culture and decorated by sentimental Hellenistic monarchs and autocrats. But it was no longer a world power. That status had passed to the Hellenistic monarchies, as had much of the wealth of the new age.</p>
        <p>A great constitutional difficulty for the Hellenistic world was the relationship of the new monarchies to the poleis, both the old and the recently established ones. Except in vestigial form monarchy did not exist in most of classical Greece. As a result there was no civic tradition in Greece that took into account the relationship of the polis to the monarch.<a name="fnd0e3267-ref" href="#fnd0e3267" data-tei-tag="ref">19</a> In Greek political tradition a hallmark of the polis was that it was—theoretically—</p>

        , free and independent. Greek concern on this point can be seen quite vividly in the invitation the Athenians extended in 377 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> to cities to join the Second Athenian League. The Athenians, sensitive after their abuse of the allies in the fifth century, specified in the invitation that each allied city was to be "free and autonomous, using whatever form of government it wants, receiving neither a garrison nor an [Athenian] governor
        <p></p>

        <p>nor paying tribute."<a name="fnd0e3325-ref" href="#fnd0e3325" data-tei-tag="ref">20</a> Ideally these were the conditions under which a completely free city could exist; these conditions were obviously incompatible with the centralized control of a Hellenistic kingdom. In fact, one of the great polarities of the Hellenistic monarchies was the tension between the Greek tradition of the independent polis and the central control that could be exerted by the king. This tension can be seen dearly, for example, in the actions of Antigonos Monophthalmos who publicly assured cities under his rule of their "freedom and autonomy" and then proceeded to impose his dictates when necessary.<a name="fnd0e3335-ref" href="#fnd0e3335" data-tei-tag="ref">21</a></p>
        <p>Thus in 311 B.C.  Antigonos proglaimed his readiness to preserve the freedom and autonomy of the Greeks.&nbsp; This intention is preserved in a letter Antigonos sent to the city of Skepsis in the Troad announcing the peace that had just been concluded with Kassandros, Lysimachos, and Ptolemy (<i class="italic">RC</i> 1.2, 55, 61).&nbsp; In fact, the subsequent experience of Skepsis may serve as an example of the problem facing king and city. In the same year Skepsis voted to set up a cult image and to establish divine honors for Antigonos.&nbsp; The inscription recording this decree also mentions an earlier festival for Antigonos, presumably also involving divine honors (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 6.10-35).&nbsp; The honors voted in 311 B.C. were in gratitude for the recent peace and guarantee of autonomy and freedom. It is instructive—and sobering—to follow the next step in the  history of Skepsis. A few years later Antigonos forced its population to join his foundation of Antigoneia Troas (Strabo 13.1.33); SO much for "freedom and autonomy." This short excursus on Skepsis' history brings into focus a number of points: the desire by the king to appear as a champion of the freedom of the Greeks, the desire of the city to reciprocate this benefaction, and, finally, the king's ability to override this freedom when he chose. Let us consider these points briefly as they relate to the new poleis.</p>
        <p>Antigonos and his son, Demetrios, were masters of public relations. Unlike Antipater and his son, Kassandros, Antigonos followed Alexander in professing concern for the freedom of the Greek cities. I will not enter here into a discussion of the sincerity of this concern. Rather I would point out that the public relations campaign was one aspect of a larger effort by all the kings to lavish benefactions—in the form of both civic grants and material gifts—on both the old and the new cities in their respective empires and beyond. Such</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_25" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">25</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_25"></div>
        <p>efforts advertised to the Hellenistic word the kings' philhellenism and made visible to the Greco-Macedonian settlers the royal concern for their welfare and loyalty. As in so many other areas, here too Alexander set the standard. Immediately after his victory at the battle of the Granikos River Alexander visited ILION. According to Strabo (13.1.26) he decorated the temple with offerings, bestowed on the city the title "polis," gave orders to improve the city with buildings, and determined it would be free and exempt from tribute. After the "overthrow of the Persians" he sent a letter to Ilion promising to make it a "great polis," to build a notable sanctuary, and to proclaim sacred games.</p>
        <p>Alexander did not live to carry out all these plans. Nevertheless, Strabo's lists may serve as a useful illustration of the types of benefits a city could expect. The example set by Alexander was in fact followed by his successors and in this way developed the tradition of Hellenistic kings and queens as benefactors and patrons.<a name="fnd0e3362-ref" href="#fnd0e3362" data-tei-tag="ref">22</a> A good indication of the importance attached to public benefaction by the Hellenistic kings can be seen in the fact that after an earthquake devastated Rhodes in 228/7, it received contributions from Hieron and Gelon, Ptolemy III, Antigonos Doson, Seleukos III, Prousias I, and Mithridates II, as well as Lysanias, Olympichos, and Limnaios (Polyb. 5.88-90.4).<a name="fnd0e3405-ref" href="#fnd0e3405" data-tei-tag="ref">23</a> The attention paid to Rhodes calls to mind the numerous urban rehabilitation projects undertaken by the various monarchs. These could, for example, involve cities that had been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable by war or natural causes. I have already mentioned Kassandros' rebuilding of THEBE. Prousias I did the same for Kios and renamed it for himself. Antiochos III rebuilt the abandoned</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_26" class="page-break-container">

          <hr id="JD_Page_26"></div>
        <p>LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace and was responsible for restoring sections of SARDIS and AMYZON.</p>
        <p>Royal benefactions were also showered on the new settlements, often at the time of their founding. This happened, for example, at THEBES, LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, APOLLONIS, SARDIS, EUPATORIA Amisos, and the JEWISH COLONIES in Lydia and Phrygia. It was undoubtedly in connection with the founding of DEMETRIAS Sikyon that Demetrios Poliorketes' mistress, Lamia, gave a painted stoa to the city. According to Strabo, "the kings" (unidentified) "adorned Stratonikeia [i.e., in Caria] with expensive buildings" (14.2.25), and another unidentified king wrote to NYSA in the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> that he would give it "all the other benefactions (<i class="italic">philanthropa</i> ) and honors (<i class="italic">teimia</i> ) which the kings before us granted" (<i class="italic">RC</i> 64.13). Eumenes II and other Attalid kings lavished much attention on Pergamon (Strabo 13.4.1-2). The libraries at PERGAMON and Alexandreia are excellent examples of Hellenistic royal patronage.<a name="fnd0e3455-ref" href="#fnd0e3455" data-tei-tag="ref">24</a> But if a king could give, he could take away. I have already mentioned that Antiochos IV was generous in giving gifts to cities. He was also generous in giving cities as gifts. According to the author of 2 Maccabees (4.30-31) Antiochos gave ANTIOCH on the Kydnos and Mallos as a gift to his mistress. In both cities this gift caused riots that could be quelled only by the king's presence! Finally, we may expect that gifts were often given with strings—-overtly or covertly—attached. Polybius, for example, describes (22.7-8) how King Eumenes wanted to give the Achaeans 125 talents. The interest from this was to be used to pay the Achaean council. We are told that Apollonides of Sikyon, among others, vigorously opposed Eumenes' gift on the grounds that it would allow the Attalid king to interfere in the affairs of the League. Ultimately the Achaeans decided not to accept the gift, though Polybius adds that its magnitude made it "hard to resist"!</p>
        <p>In addition to material gifts, kings made numerous grants of civic benefits to cities. For example, Demetrios Poliorketes reestablished <i class="italic">eleutheria</i> , (freedom) for DEMETRIAS Sikyon, and King Antiochos promised to guard LYSIMACHEIA's [autonomy], democracy, to keep it ungarrisoned and [<i class="italic">aphorologeros</i> ]. In Asia Minor fragmentary inscriptions indicate SELEUKEIA Tralleis was receiving privileges, including some kind of relief, probably from Antiochos III. Seleukos I and Antiochos I granted NYSA the right to be <i class="italic">asylos</i> , while another king whose name is lost confirmed it in <i class="italic">hikesia</i> (the right to receive suppliants), <i class="italic"> asylia</i> , and <i class="italic">ateleia</i> (tax exemption), rights that "[had been previously granted</p>

          <a name="fnd0e3515-ref" href="#fnd0e3515" data-tei-tag="ref">25</a></p>
        <p>The cities reciprocated this beneficent attention with demonstrations of goodwill. These demonstrations could take a number of forms, depending on the benefactors and the magnitude of the gift. Cities could vote, among other things, a decree of praise, free meals, <i class="italic">proedria</i> at games, citizenship, or <i class="italic"> ateleia</i> . Such honors were liberally given to prominent and generous individuals. For example, APOLLONIA Salbake granted citizen rights, <i class="italic">ateleia</i> , and <i class="italic">proedria</i> to the Seleucid hipparch stationed there. But the greatest honor a Hellenistic city could give—normally reserved for a ruler and, occasionally, his wife—was the establishment of a cult. While civic cults first appeared at the end of the Peloponnesian War when Samos established one for Lysander, the phenomenon proliferated under Alexander and during the Hellenistic period.<a name="fnd0e3546-ref" href="#fnd0e3546" data-tei-tag="ref">26</a> The spread of civic cults in fact coincides with the decline of the independence of the polis in the age of monarchy. At the same time the cults reflect the historical importance and centrality of religion in the classical polis. Cults and the public festivals of civic deities, such as Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus at Athens, were as commonly found in Greece as were hero cults and founder cults.<a name="fnd0e3559-ref" href="#fnd0e3559" data-tei-tag="ref">27</a> In discussing the creation of new political subdivisions in his Cretan city, Plato specifies that each section was to be assigned a god or daimon, or at least a hero (<i class="italic">Leg</i> . 738D).<a name="fnd0e3584-ref" href="#fnd0e3584" data-tei-tag="ref">28</a> The new political reality for poleis created by the establishment of the Hellenistic monarchies likewise necessitated the creation of new cults. These cults allowed the cities to</p>

        <p>relate in a meaningful way to their new reality. It also allowed the cities to curry favor with the king.</p>
        <p>Many of the Greek cities of western Asia Minor, among them ILION and PRIENE, established cults in honor of Alexander the Great.<a name="fnd0e3608-ref" href="#fnd0e3608" data-tei-tag="ref">29</a> The practice continued after his death and spread.<a name="fnd0e3645-ref" href="#fnd0e3645" data-tei-tag="ref">30</a> Cults for the various rulers, frequently as founders, were set up in many of the Hellenistic settlements. We find such evidence at KASSANDREIA, DEMETRIAS in Thessaly, DEMETRIAS Sikyon, ILION, PERGAMON, KOLOPHON, ARSINOE Ephesos, SARDIS, NYSA, ANTIOCH on the Maeander, APOLLONIA Salbake, APAMEIA Kelainai, HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia, LAODIKEIA on the Lykos, EUMENEIA, APOLLONIA in Phrygia, ARSINOE in Cilicia, and PROUSIAS on the Hypios. There is abundant evidence from the early Hellenistic period indicating that such cults were frequently established in gratitude for royal favor. This was the case, for example, at ILION, the Ionian League, Smyrna, and Teos.<a name="fnd0e3667-ref" href="#fnd0e3667" data-tei-tag="ref">31</a> The inscriptions from Smyrna and Teos give a rather full explanation of the circumstances underlying the establishment of the cult. The preamble of the Smyrna decree regarding Seleukos II begins: "Resolved by the people, the proposal of the generals. Since previously at the time when King Seleukos (II) crossed over to Seleukis and many great dangers surrounded our city and territory, the people maintained its goodwill and friendship toward him, neither being frightened by the attack of the enemy nor caring about the destruction of its property, but considering everything to be secondary to continuing in its policy and to keeping a share in (the King's) interests to the best of its ability just as it promised at first; and wherefore King Seleukos, showing piety toward the gods and affection toward his parents, being generous and knowing how to return favors to his benefactors, honored our city because of the goodwill of the people and the ambitions it displayed for his interests and because of the establishment of the cult of his father Antiochos Theos and his father's mother Stratonike Thea in our city in which they are given remarkable honors publicly by the people and privately by each of the citizens and he guaranteed</p>

        <p>to the people its autonomy and democracy and he wrote to the kings and dynasts, the cities and the peoples (<i class="italic">ethne</i> ), asking that the temple of Aphrodite Stratonikis be acknowledged to be inviolate and our city holy and inviolate ..." (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 229.1-12). The preamble of the Teos decree likewise presents a picture of a reciprocally beneficial relationship: "[Proposal of the] <i class="italic">timouchoi</i> [and generals: since King] Antiochos (III) ... favorable policy [and preserving ... the] goodwill he shows and which he inherited from his [ancestors], and ... intends to ... manifold, and intends to be the common [benefactor] of the other Greek [cities and] of our own city. Previously, when staying in the region beyond the Tauros, he was the cause of many benefits to us; when he came to our region he settled affairs in an advantageous way, and when he stayed in our city he saw that we were exhausted both in our public and our private affairs because of the continuous wars and the great burden of contributions we were bearing. Wishing to display piety towards the gods to whom he consecrated our city and territory, and wanting to do a favour to the people and the association of Dionysiac artists, he came forward in person in the assembly and granted to our city and territory (to be) holy <i class="italic">(hiera)</i> , inviolate <i class="italic">(asylos)</i> and free from tribute <i class="italic">(aphorologetos)</i> and undertook to free us himself from the other contributions we pay to King Attalos (I) so that by bringing about an improvement in the city's fortunes he would receive the rifle not only of benefactor of the people, but of its saviour. He stayed in the city with his friends and the military forces which accompanied him, and gave ample evidence of the good faith he already shows towards all men, and after this has constantly been responsible for many favours to us, thereby giving an example to all the Greeks of how he treats those who are his benefactors and who are well disposed towards him; some of the blessings which resulted in prosperity for our city he is now bringing about, while others he will bring about in future. He wrote a letter to the people in which he suggested the sending of an embassy [to him] to discuss the matters he said he was convinced would [benefit] the people as well, and when the people sent as ambassadors Dionysios son of Apollo ... Hermagoras son of Epimenes, Theodoros son of Zopyros, he declared to them [that] he had freed the city for all time as he had promised of the tributes which we paid to King Attalos. Concerning these matters he sent a letter in which he said he had instructed the ambassadors to report to us, and the ambassadors reported these matters [to the people]. In the same way his sister and queen Laodice constantly shares the same view as the king in [all circumstances] ... and in good deeds towards the city she shows [herself] eager and zealous to perform benefactions, and the people has received the greatest [blessings] from both of them. Therefore, so that we may be seen in every [circumstance] to be returning adequate thanks to the king and to the queen and to be surpassing ourselves in the honours paid to</p>

        <p>them in proportion to the benefactions received, and so that all may see that the [people] is fully disposed to repay gratitude ..."<a name="fnd0e3739-ref" href="#fnd0e3739" data-tei-tag="ref">32</a> The extent to which both monarch and city went to publicize their appreciation of each other is an interesting phenomenon of the Hellenistic age. It was in fact a common occurrence for cities to point out in decrees that they knew how to repay benefactors. For example, the preamble of the Athenian decree for Kallias of Sphettos includes the statement "therefore so that all who wish to show zeal towards the city may know that the people always remember those who have benefited it and repay thanks to everyone of them... "<a name="fnd0e3749-ref" href="#fnd0e3749" data-tei-tag="ref">33</a> It was obviously important for cities to demonstrate their appreciation of royal benefactions, just as it was important for the monarchs to show their appreciation of civic goodwill. This mutual need smoothed over the potentially difficult situation created by the exercise of centralized authority over the poleis. After all, the Hellenistic kingdoms outside of Macedonia were personal rather than national monarchies, held as spear-won territories. As Diodorus writes (19.105.4), these kingdoms consisted of <i class="italic">ethne</i> and poleis. The kings ruled empires planted in foreign lands that had large components of <i class="italic">ethne</i> . The <i class="italic">ethne</i> were the native substratum in which the new Greco-Macedonian poleis existed. Above all else the kings needed the loyalty and the support of the Greco-Macedonians if they were to maintain their hold on the throne. The Teos decree makes this quite clear. Having elucidated the benefactions Antiochos III had bestowed on it, the decree of Teos explains that this gives "an example to <i class="italic">all the Greeks</i> of how he treats those who are his benefactors and who are well disposed towards him" (emphasis mine).<a name="fnd0e3756-ref" href="#fnd0e3756" data-tei-tag="ref">34</a> The ruler cult provided a concrete means whereby the poleis could publicly acknowledge their benefactors. And their benefactors were always happy to be recognized. But all the benefactions and diplomatic courtesies could not hide the hard fact that power ultimately lay with the ruler, not the polis. Ruler cult was a partial solution at best for the problems the cities faced.</p>

        <p>derstanding the policies and the concerns underlying the settlement programs of the various Hellenistic monarchs. With that in mind, therefore, I should like to examine briefly the various regions that were colonized by the kings.</p>
        <div id="d0e1634" data-tei-tag="div3" data-type="ss2">
          <h3 class="Heading-Heading4"><a href="#d0e1634" class="heading-link">Europe</a></h3>
          <p>When Plutarch (<i class="italic">De Alex. fort</i> . I.328E), Ammianus Marcellinus (14.8.6), and Libanius (<i class="italic">Or</i> . 11.101) discussed the achievement of Alexander and the Seleucids in founding settlements they were clearly thinking primarily of Asia. Certainly one would have to grant that the most dramatic results of their work were in that part of the world. In this region extended contacts between the native population and Greeks and Macedonians first occurred as a result of Alexander's conquests. The contrast in the demographic picture before and after the advent of the Macedonian was overwhelming. According to Plutarch, "by founding more than seventy cities among the barbarian tribes and by spreading Greek magistracies over Asia, Alexander overcame its wild and uncivilized way of life." Plutarch's encomium for Alexander later found an echo in Libanius' praise for Seleukos I Nikator as a colonizer of Asia. Nevertheless we should not forget that there were Hellenistic settlements established in Europe as well and, as far as we know, that some of the earliest foundations of the Diadochoi were built there. I have already mentioned that some of these settlements resulted from synoecisms. Other settlements were refounded older towns. Not surprisingly, there is no firm evidence in Macedonia or Greece for military colonies of the type found in central Anatolia. They would hardly have been needed in Macedonia or tolerated in Greece.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">Epirus, Illyria, and Thrace</i> . Epirus, Illyria, and Thrace were on the periphery of the Greek and Macedonian world. The Macedonian expansion toward these regions in the latter part of the fourth century resulted in the building of a number of foundations. Many of the Hellenistic settlements there as well as in Macedonia and Thessaly were located on north-south routes running from the Danube region to central and southern Greece.</p>
          <p>While not a direct possession of Alexander, Epirus came under Kassandros' rule around 314 <span class="smallcaps">B.C</span> . Subsequently it passed to Pyrrhos. The former founded ANTIPATREIA in southern Illyria, and the latter established ANTIGONEIA in Epirus. Both settlements were strategically located. Livy (31.27.1) described Antipatreia as a fortified city in a narrow pass. Antigoneia overlooked the gorge of the Drin River, which was the main route from north into central Epirus.</p>
          <p>I have already mentioned the pacification program of Thrace that was undertaken by Philip II and his use of population transfers and colony foundings</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_32" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">32</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_32"></div>
          <p>for this purpose. In 340 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> his son built ALEXANDROPOLIS after subduing a rebellion of the tribe of the Maidoi. The most important Hellenistic settlement in Thrace was LYSIMACHEIA. According to Appian (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 1) it was built in 309 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> as a bulwark against the Thracians. Subsequently it was destroyed by the Thracians. Nevertheless the importance of its location was such that Antiochos III decided to rebuild it in 196 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> as a residence for his son.</p>
          <p>According to the Adoulis inscription (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 54) Ptolemy III Euergetes I included Thrace and the Hellespont among his conquests. Polybius (5.34.7-8) mentions that at the accession of Ptolemy IV Philopator the Egyptians held the main points of the Asia Minor coast from Pamphylia to the Hellespont, including places around LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, Ainos, and Maroneia. Polybius notes that this gave the Ptolemies strong influence over the affairs of Thrace and Macedonia.<a name="fnd0e3840-ref" href="#fnd0e3840" data-tei-tag="ref">35</a> Despite this there is no evidence that the Ptolemies established any colonies in Thrace.</p>
          <p>After the defeat of Antiochos III at the battle of Magnesia Eumenes II received Antiochos' European possessions. These included Lysimacheia and the Thracian Chersonese as well as points on the north shore of the Propontis (Polyb. 21.45.9), among which was PANION.<a name="fnd0e3847-ref" href="#fnd0e3847" data-tei-tag="ref">36</a> Evidence for an Attalid colony at Panion can be seen in five honorific inscriptions for Attalid kings that have been discovered there.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">Macedonia</i> . After the death of Alexander, Antipater remained in control of Macedon. Following his death in 319 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> his son, Kassandros, ultimately succeeded him. Married to Alexander's half sister, Thessalonike, Kassandros emulated him by founding new settlements with dynastic names. Kassandros, in fact, was the first of Alexander's successors to do this. In 316 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> he founded by synoecism the city of KASSANDREIA and began the rebuilding of THEBES in Boeotia. Probably around the same time he built, also by synoecism, THESSALONIKE. HIS example was soon followed by the other Diadochoi.</p>
          <p>The Antigonid rulers were also active founding colonies in Macedonia and in Thessaly. In Macedonia, for example, we encounter ANTIGONEIAS in Chalcidice and in Paeonia, DEMETRIAS, PERSEIS, PHILA, and STRATONIKEIA. While the exact location of many of these settlements cannot be specified, it is quite probable that many of them were located at strategically important sites. For instance, ANTIGONEIA in Paeonia was on the Axios River on the road from Stobi to Thessalonike (Pliny <i class="italic">NH</i> 4.34 and <i class="italic">Tab. Peut</i> . VIII.5).</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_33" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">33</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_33"></div>
          <p>The so-called Iron Gate of the middle valley of the Axios was a gorge that provided the easiest access from the lands of the Danube into Macedonia. It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that ANTIGONEIA was located in this general area.<a name="fnd0e3879-ref" href="#fnd0e3879" data-tei-tag="ref">37</a> Similarly, PHILA occupied an important site at the northern entrance to the Vale of Tempe. Finally, I might mention Aristotle's native town, Stageira, which was destroyed along with Olynthos by Philip II in 348 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> It was subsequently restored, probably by Philip himself. Tradition also recorded that he did this at the urging of his son and out of respect for the latter's teacher, Aristotle.<a name="fnd0e3889-ref" href="#fnd0e3889" data-tei-tag="ref">38</a></p>
          <p><i class="italic">Thessaly and Aetolia</i> . The most important Hellenistic settlement in Thessaly was DEMETRIAS. Like KASSANDREIA and THESSALONIKE, it was established by synoecism. The founder was Demetrios Poliorketes. Its location should be noted. Not only did it dominate the southern access to the Vale of Tempe, it was a coastal city with a harbor: despite his conquest of Macedonia Demetrios was still very concerned about supporting the Antigonid navy in the Aegean. Furthermore, together with Chalkis and Korinth it was considered to be one of the "fetters of Greece" (Strabo 9.4. 15; Livy 32.37.3; Polyb. 18.11.4-7). Control of these cities, along with Piraeus when possible, gave the Antigonids control over central and southern Greece. It also helped prevent the Ptolemies from establishing themselves there. Other Antigonid settlements in Thessaly included OLYMPIAS, the refounded fortress-village of Gonnokondylon, PHILIPPOPOLIS Gomphoi, which guarded two of the passes from Epirus into Thessaly, and Phthiotic Thebes, the Aetolian stronghold that had been threatening Philip V's communication with the south. Philip captured the latter place in 217 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and refounded it as a PHILIPPOPOLIS.</p>
          <p>In Aetolia there were four cities that should be noted—ARSINOE Konope, LYSIMACHEIA, PTOLEMAIS, and ATTALEIA. The first will have been named for Arsinoe (the wife of Lysimachos and, later, of Ptolemy II Philadelphos), the</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_34" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">34</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_34"></div>
          <p>second for Lysimachos, the third for Ptolemy III Euergetes I, and the fourth for Attalos I. The founders are not definitely known. However, since the settlements were in Aetolian territory, I do not think they were built by Arsinoe, Lysimachos, Ptolemy, or Attalos. Hellenistic rulers did not normally establish settlements in regions they did not rule. Furthermore it is hardly likely the host state would have allowed it. Rather I believe these settlements were named by the Aetolians to honor allied monarchs. This, too, was somewhat unusual but not completely out of character for the diplomatically adroit Aetolians.<a name="fnd0e3939-ref" href="#fnd0e3939" data-tei-tag="ref">39</a></p>
          <p><i class="italic">The Peloponnese</i> . Settlement building south of Thessaly was limited. Those sections of central and southern Greece that were under Macedonian hegemony were usually controlled by garrisons rather than settlements.<a name="fnd0e3949-ref" href="#fnd0e3949" data-tei-tag="ref">40</a> In fact the only Macedonian foundation south of Thessaly was DEMETRIAS, Poliorketes' refoundation of Sikyon. The capture of Mantineia in 223 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> by the Achaeans with the help of Antigonos Doson was followed by the enslavement of its population and the distribution of its wealth to the conquerors. Subsequently the Achaeans refounded it as ANTIGONEIA. Finally, Methana was refounded as ARSINOE, most probably by Arsinoe II Philadelphos. The latter represents our only known example of a Ptolemaic foundation on the mainland of Greece. The important docking facilities make clear that its primary function was to service the Egyptian fleet in the Aegean.<a name="fnd0e3959-ref" href="#fnd0e3959" data-tei-tag="ref">41</a></p>

          <p>I group together all the settlements that were located on the various islands in the Propontis, the Aegean, and the Mediterranean. This is, of course, arbitrary. An island in the Propontis has little in common with Crete and less in common with Cyprus other than that all are islands. Furthermore it may well be argued that geopolitically Cyprus should be grouped with Cilicia or northern Syria.<a name="fnd0e3966-ref" href="#fnd0e3966" data-tei-tag="ref">42</a> Nevertheless, for the sake of convenience I put all the islands in one section. That having been said, one is immediately struck by the fact</p>

            <hr id="JD_Page_35"></div>
          <p>that of the eight settlements in this section six are named ARSINOE: an accurate reflection of the strength of the Ptolemaic thalassocracy and the influence of Queen Arsinoe II, after whom most if not all the towns were named.</p>
          <p>The Ptolemies first gained control of Cyprus in 311/10 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , lost it to Demetrios Poliorketes in 306, and retook it permanently in 294.<a name="fnd0e4010-ref" href="#fnd0e4010" data-tei-tag="ref">43</a> Cyprus is strategically located in the eastern Mediterranean, facing both the south coast of Asia Minor and the north coast of Syria. As such it commanded the shipping lanes between Egypt, these areas, and the Aegean. Control of it was obviously vital if the Ptolemies were to extend their empire beyond Egypt. Cyprus also played a major role in Ptolemaic strategic planning. It was a major source for timber and a key center for Ptolemaic shipbuilding.<a name="fnd0e4020-ref" href="#fnd0e4020" data-tei-tag="ref">44</a> In addition, it is well to recall that the Arsinoe settlements on Cyprus (and elsewhere) were harbors. In fact Cyprus was known in antiquity for its numerous harbors.<a name="fnd0e4030-ref" href="#fnd0e4030" data-tei-tag="ref">45</a> Ammianus Marcellinus (14.8.14), for example, referred to it as an <i class="italic">insula portuosa</i> . In short both the location and the resources of Cyprus contributed to its importance for the Ptolemies.</p>
          <p>In the first half of the third century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> the Egyptians controlled much of the Aegean, in particular the Cycladic islands. The instrument of control was the League of the Islanders, which the Ptolemies took over from Demetrios Poliorketes after 287 B.C. and which they held for the next generation. The Ptolemaic presence in the area is reflected in Arsinoes on Crete, on Keos, and on the Greek mainland at Methana in the Argolid.<a name="fnd0e4037-ref" href="#fnd0e4037" data-tei-tag="ref">46</a> As was the case elsewhere, these Arsinoes were ports serving the needs of the Ptolemaic fleet and travelers. The utilitarian function of the Arsinoes is seen quite clearly in the case of ARSINOE Methana, where an agreement between it and Troizen makes extensive reference to the docking facilities (<i class="italic">IG</i> IV<sup class="superscript">2</sup> 76). Another ARSINOE, this</p>

          <p>one the refounded Patara on the Lycian coast, was a way station for travelers. A Zenon papyrus describes how two travelers, Ariston and his sister Doris, had been forced by a storm to put in at Patara and had then hired a boat to continue their travels (<i class="italic">P. Mich. Zen</i> . 1.10). Interestingly, their destination was another Arsinoe. What was true for Arsinoe Methana and Patara was also true for the other Arsinoes and other Egyptian settlements in the Aegean, on Cyprus, and on the southern coast of Asia Minor.</p>

          <h3 class="Heading-Heading4"><a href="#d0e1898" class="heading-link">Asia Minor</a></h3>
          <p>Asia Minor was ruled by Antigonos Monophthalmos until his death in 301 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> at the battle of Ipsos (Diod. 19.105. 1). After his death most of central and western Asia Minor fell to Lysimachos. The southern coast passed first to Kassandros' brother, Pleistarchos, then to Demetrios Poliorketes. In c. 295 Demetrios lost control of this area to Seleukos I Nikator and Ptolemy I Soter. As a result the former took hold of most, if not all, of Cilicia, and the latter probably gained Pamphylia and Lycia.<a name="fnd0e4090-ref" href="#fnd0e4090" data-tei-tag="ref">47</a> Lysimachos was defeated by Seleukos I and killed at the battle of Korupedion in 281. Seleukos now took control of most of Asia Minor. The Seleucid hold on Asia Minor was, however, far from complete; large parts of the subcontinent never actually came under their rule. Bithynia, Pontus, and Paphlagonia were effectively beyond their control, as was the area that became Galatia, Cappadocia, and much of the interior region of Pisidia. Furthermore, in the course of the third century Pergamon under Philetairos and his successors managed to slip out from under Seleucid rule. Finally, substantial sections of both the west and the south coast were, at various times, under Ptolemaic rule. Thus, in the third century a significant portion of Asia Minor was not under Seleucid control. What, then, was ruled by the Seleucids in the first half of the third century? The Troad, Aeolis and Mysia (with the exception of the slowly emerging Pergamon), parts of Ionia and Carla, Lydia and Phrygia, as well as Lycaonia and the border areas of Pisidia and some regions of the south coast, especially Cilicia. Seleucid control of Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains extended only through the reigns of Antiochos I and II, that is, until 246 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> This was also the period of greatest colonizing activity.</p>

In that year Antiochos III finally overcame and executed another Seleucid usurper, Achaios, and thus brought the region under Seleucid hegemony. He also reconquered various coastal areas of Asia Minor in 197, but this was, likewise, to be temporary. His defeat at the hands of the Romans in 190 resulted in the permanent expulsion of the Seleucids from all of Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains. M. Cary has referred to the "Balkanization" of Asia Minor.<a name="fnd0e4133-ref" href="#fnd0e4133" data-tei-tag="ref">48</a> Certainly this is an accurate characterization of the region after 246. In such an environment we should hardly expect to find the kings founding many colonies, if any at all. This was apparently the situation. At any rate our sources, spotty as they are, make no mention of it under Seleukos II or III. Under Antiochos III there was renewed colonizing activity, albeit on a far more modest scale than that seen under the first Seleucids.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">The Troad</i> . The Troad was strategically important because it controlled not only the Hellespont but also the land route to Europe. In the generation of the Diadochoi both Antigonos Monophthalmos and Lysimachos gave particular attention to the cities of the Troad. Antigonos founded ANTIGONEIA Troas through a synoecism involving numerous surrounding towns. After the battle of Ipsos in 301 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Lysimachos refounded the city as an ALEXANDREIA. The commercial importance of Alexandreia is clear: it had the only good harbor on the west coast of the Troad. It was also important strategically to both Antigonos and Lysimachos because it assured a link between Macedonia and Asia Minor.<a name="fnd0e4139-ref" href="#fnd0e4139" data-tei-tag="ref">49</a> ILION, as might be expected, was the object of universal attention. By the time Alexander reached it in 334 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> it was no longer a major urban center. Alexander had great plans for rebuilding it. What he actually did is not clear. In any event Antigonos may have founded the Federation of the Troad with its center at the temple of Athena in Ilion. It is also possible that he began the building of the temple.<a name="fnd0e4149-ref" href="#fnd0e4149" data-tei-tag="ref">50</a> Lysimachos also took an active interest in Ilion. According to Strabo (13.1.26) Lysimachos actually built the temple of Athena. In addition he built a circuit wall and transferred the population of towns and villages in the vicinity to Ilion. Seleukos Nikator gained control of the Troad as a result of his victory at Korupedion in 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> The region remained firmly in Seleucid hands until at least the middle of the century. There were Seleucid mints at ALEXANDREIA Troas, ILION, Lampsakos, Abydos, Skepsis,</p>

          <p>and Parion.<a name="fnd0e4214-ref" href="#fnd0e4214" data-tei-tag="ref">51</a> Further evidence for the Seleucids in the Troad can be seen in the famous series of inscriptions recording Antiochos I's gift of land to Aristodikides (<i class="italic">RC</i> 10-13) and Antiochos II's sale of land to Laodike (<i class="italic">RC</i> 18-20). Despite this evidence the only settlement in the Troad that can be attributed to the Seleucids with any degree of probability is ANTIOCH, the refounded Kebren. With the rise of Antiochos Hietax (c. 239 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ) the Troad passed from central Seleucid authority to the control of the usurper.</p>
          <p>Apparently at some point in the second half of the third century all or some of the Troad came under temporary Ptolemaic domination. According to the Adoulis inscription (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 54.14-15) Ptolemy III Euergetes I claimed the Hellespont and Thrace as one of his conquests in the Third Syrian War (246-241 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ). Louis Robert has suggested that during the Ptolemaic presence in the Troad Larisa was refounded as a PTOLEMAIS.</p>
          <p>In the latter part of the third century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> Attalos I maintained good relations with a number of cities in the Troad, among which were Lampsakos, ILION, and ALEXANDREIA Troas (Polyb. 5.78.6).<a name="fnd0e4224-ref" href="#fnd0e4224" data-tei-tag="ref">52</a> We know of at least one Attalid settlement in the Troad, the <i class="italic">katoikia</i> of the AIGOSAOES.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">Mysia and Aeolis</i> . According to Stephanos (s.v. "Antigoneia") there was an ANTIGONEIA that was a "fortress" of the Kyzikene and was fifty stades from the "Western Sea." While the location is not precisely known, it is likely that it was in Mysia. R. A. Billows has suggested that Antigonos Monophthalmos founded this colony and three other ANTIGONEIAS (the later Alexandreia Troas, near Daskyleion, and Nikaia) in order to control the region after the rebellion of Phoinix in 310 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> and, possibly, to counter Lysimachos' new settlement of LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace.<a name="fnd0e4231-ref" href="#fnd0e4231" data-tei-tag="ref">53</a> It is probable that Lysimachos also founded a LYSIMACHEIA on the coast of Aeolis. However, other than Pliny's reference to it (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.122) we know nothing else about the settlement.</p>
          <p>After the battle of Korupedion the Seleucids took control of Mysia and Aeolis. Evidence for their presence in Aeolis can be seen in the purchase by the town of Pitane of some land on the Gulf of Adramyttion from Antiochos I (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 335. 135f. = <i class="italic">SEG</i> IV.68o). The purchase price was apparently quite high; in any event Pitane could not afford to make the transaction alone. As a result Philetairos, who according to Strabo (13.4.1) always paid court to those who were powerful or living nearby, gave the city at least thirty talents in</p>

          <p>order to help with the purchase.<a name="fnd0e4269-ref" href="#fnd0e4269" data-tei-tag="ref">54</a> In addition we have evidence for Seleucid mints at Aigai, Kyme, Myrina, and PERGAMON.<a name="fnd0e4296-ref" href="#fnd0e4296" data-tei-tag="ref">55</a> Before 188 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> the area under Pergamene rule undulated considerably. In this period continuous and permanent Attalid hegemony over Mysian territory was apparently limited to Pergamon and its surroundings.<a name="fnd0e4306-ref" href="#fnd0e4306" data-tei-tag="ref">56</a> Pergamon was, of course, the most important city of Mysia. I include it among the list of Hellenistic settlements because Philetairos, the founder of the Attalid dynasty, undertook major urban development programs in the city and, as a result, was honored as a "founder" by the Pergamenes. There were also Macedonians settled in the city (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 338.14) and a military colony, name unknown, nearby.<a name="fnd0e4331-ref" href="#fnd0e4331" data-tei-tag="ref">57</a> Another Attalid foundation in Mysia was PHILETAIREIA by Ida. M. I. Rostovtzeff has emphasized the importance of the area around Mount Ida, noting that its forests were the primary source of timber for the Attalid navy (Strabo 13.1.51), it was an important horse-breeding region (Plut. <i class="italic">Eum</i> . 8.3), and it contained the only major copper and silver mines in the area (Strabo 13.1.51, 56).<a name="fnd0e4338-ref" href="#fnd0e4338" data-tei-tag="ref">58</a> To the east, the valley of the Kaikos River had to be protected from the Bithynians and Galatians. This undoubtedly explains the Pergamene decision to establish a settlement at GERGITHA (Strabo 13.1.70).</p>
          <p>The Attalids were only one—and certainly the best known—f a number of local dynasties that grew up in Asia Minor in the wake of the weakness</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_40" class="page-break-container">

          <p>of the central Seleucid authority. Another, apparently short-lived, dynastic family was one whose chief members were Lysias and Philomelos. This dynasty founded at least two settlements in southeastern Phrygia, LYSIAS and PHILOMELION. It is not clear whether other settlements, such as DOKIMEION and THEMISONION, also in Phrygia, were founded by dynasts or by generals acting on behalf of a particular king.<a name="fnd0e4377-ref" href="#fnd0e4377" data-tei-tag="ref">59</a></p>
          <p>In Mysia, too, we encounter an APOLLONIA (Strabo 13-4.4). It has been suggested that this city and APOLLONIA on the Maeander in Lydia were Attalid colonies, named for Queen Apollonis, the wife of Attalos I and the revered mother of both Eumenes II and Attalos H.<a name="fnd0e4384-ref" href="#fnd0e4384" data-tei-tag="ref">60</a> However, it is not likely that either was a Pergamene foundation. In the <i class="italic">Anabasis</i> (7.8.15) Xenophon mentions an Apollonia; this may be the same as the Mysian city recorded by Strabo. Furthermore Jeanne and Louis Robert have pointed out that if these settlements had been named for Apollohis, they would have been called that rather than Apollonia.<a name="fnd0e4394-ref" href="#fnd0e4394" data-tei-tag="ref">61</a></p>
          <p><i class="italic">Ionia</i> . Ionia is, of course, a region whose Greek cities long predated the advent of the Hellenistic monarchs. Despite this there was, in the last decade of the fourth and the first decade of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , a major effort by both Antigonos Monophthalmos and Lysimachos to revitalize a number of cities there. As was the case on the Greek mainland, this was done primarily through the process of synoecism.</p>
          <p>At the end of the fourth century KOLOPHON decided to build a wall that would enclose an enlarged urban area. A long and interesting inscription survives that gives important details about its construction.<a name="fnd0e4400-ref" href="#fnd0e4400" data-tei-tag="ref">62</a> It is quite likely that Antigonos Monophthalmos played some role in this project. If we do not know specifically what Antigonos did in connection with the building of the new wall at Kolophon, we do know about his plans for Teos and Lebedos. According to a long inscription recording two letters sent by Antigonos to Teos (<i class="italic">RC</i> 3/4) the king planned to unite Lebedos and Teos by transferring the inhabitants of the former city to the latter. The plan was not implemented.</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_41" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">41</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_41"></div>
          <p>However, it is well to recall, as I have mentioned, that subsequently Lysimachos did move Lebedians to the new ARSINOE.</p>
          <p>Lysimachos was also active in Ionia. He refounded Smyrna as EURYDIKEIA and Ephesos as ARSINOE. Ancient Smyrna had apparently remained in an abject state since its destruction by Alyattes in the latter part of the sixth century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> Strabo's description (14.1.37) indicates that the new city was a synoecism: first Antigonos Monophthalmos and then Lysimachos reassembled the village communities to form the new city. It is interesting to note, incidentally, that in addition to Smyrna Lysimachos refounded at least two other settlements of Monophthalmos: ANTIGONEIA Troas as ALEXANDREIA and ANTIGONEIA in Bithynia as NIKAIA. Lysimachos' refounding of Ephesos was also a major project. It involved moving the Ephesian population to a new site closer to the sea, bringing in additional people from Kolophon and Lebedos, and building a wall for the new city. The new city was important enough for Queen Arsinoe to use as her residence in 281. Furthermore there was a royal mint there.</p>
          <p>After the battle of Korupedion in 281 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> Ionia came under Seleucid rule. Evidence for a Seleucid presence in Ionia can be seen in the royal mints at Magnesia on the Maeander, Ephesos, Smyrna, and Phokaia as well as Bargylia in northern Caria.<a name="fnd0e4435-ref" href="#fnd0e4435" data-tei-tag="ref">63</a> We also know of numerous other Ionian cities that were under Seleucid hegemony or influence.<a name="fnd0e4445-ref" href="#fnd0e4445" data-tei-tag="ref">64</a> This hegemony was, however, neither complete nor permanent. The Ptolemies were also active in the region. According to the Adoulis inscription (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 54) Ptolemy III Euergetes claimed Ionia as one of his conquests. Theocritus (17.86-90) does not mention it as belonging to Ptolemy II Philadelphos, but, as R. S. Bagnall notes, he also does not mention Cyprus, which certainly belonged to Philadelphos. According to Bagnall there is evidence for seven Ionian cities under the control of either Ptolemy II or III: Lebedos, Ephesos, Kolophon,</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_42" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">42</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_42"></div>
          <p>Magnesia, Priene, Miletos, and possibly Teos.<a name="fnd0e4531-ref" href="#fnd0e4531" data-tei-tag="ref">65</a> Despite the extensive evidence for a Seleucid and a Ptolemaic presence in Ionia the only settlement there that we can ascribe to either royal house is PTOLEMAIS, the refounded Lebedos, possibly the work of Ptolemy III. There is no other extant evidence to indicate either dynasty founded additional colonies or refounded cities in the region. This gap is striking. In the first place it contrasts sharply with the information we have for the earlier activity of Antigonos and Lysimachos in the same region. And, second, it also contrasts with the plentiful evidence for Hellenistic—and, in particular, Macedonian—colonization in neighboring Lydia and Caria. The reason for the apparent lack of colonizing in Ionia is unclear. A. H. M. Jones suggested that "the Seleucids were more interested in the interior."<a name="fnd0e4537-ref" href="#fnd0e4537" data-tei-tag="ref">66</a> Alternatively we may note the continuing struggle between the Ptolemies and the Seleucids in the region. This, however, would hardly have prevented colonization; a similar state of affairs on the south coast of Asia Minor had no such effect. Finally, we should recall that in population and history Ionia had more in common with the Greek mainland than with the rest of Asia Minor. I have already noted the absence of evidence for military colonies in Greece and the fact that in Greece south of Thessaly we know of only one Antigonid settlement—DEMETRIAS Sikyon. This was founded by Demetrios Poliorketes at the end of the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> There is no evidence for any subsequent Antigonid colonizing in the region. Apparently the Antigonids preferred to maintain their control by means of garrisons rather than colonies. We may wonder, therefore, whether Ionian Greek sensitivity about Macedonian colonization prompted the Seleucids to use garrisons—as they did, for example, at Ephesos (Ath. 593b-d)—rather than settlements to control the region.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">Lydia and Phrygia</i> . Both Lydia and Phrygia were areas of heavy colonization in the Hellenistic period. Many of the settlements were founded on or near the trade routes that connected the Aegean littoral with the East, both to protect these routes and to take advantage of the commercial opportunities they offered. Although not intensively Hellenized at the time of Alexander's arrival, Lydia and Phrygia were far more civilized than, for example, Galatia and Cappadocia. The Lydian kingdom under the Mermnad dynasty (c. 700 - 550 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ) was the dominant power in western Asia Minor until it was conquered by the Persians. And the Phrygians claimed descent from the European</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_43" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">43</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_43"></div>
          <p>Phryges, who, according to tradition, had come over to Asia Minor around the end of the second millennium <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
            <a name="fnd0e4586-ref" href="#fnd0e4586" data-tei-tag="ref"> 67</a></p>
          <p>The evidence for Antigonos Monophthalmos' settlements in Asia Minor is limited to the west and northwest coastal region. We have no definite information about any active colonizing by him in the interior, that is, in Lydia and Phrygia. In Phrygia DOKIMEION was probably founded by Dokimos, Antigonos' general. But did he found Dokimeion as Antigonos' general or as an independent dynast? The same question may also be asked about SYNNADA. Whatever Dokimos' status we should note in passing that he was active around the end of the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> This would place Dokimeion and Synnada among the earliest Hellenistic settlements in Asia Minor. As for Kelainai, we know that it was the capital of the Persian satrapy of Phrygia (Xen. <i class="italic">Anab</i> . 1.2.7-9; Art. <i class="italic">Anab</i> . 1.29.1), that Antigonos was frequently to be found there (Diod. 18.52.1; 19.69.2 and 93.4; Plut. <i class="italic"> Demetr</i> . 6.3), and that Eumenes wintered there in 321 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Plut. <i class="italic">Eum</i> . 8.4).<a name="fnd0e4590-ref" href="#fnd0e4590" data-tei-tag="ref">68</a> What we do not know is whether Antigonos actually refounded the city (as Antiochos I later did) or whether he brought colonists to it. Finally, KRETOPOLIS in Pisidia: it is possible that it <i class="italic">was</i> a Hellenistic foundation. Unfortunately the circumstances of its founding—assuming it was a Hellenistic colony—are completely unknown. Discussion about Antigonos' possible role in founding it is speculative and should not be pressed.</p>
          <p>In discussing Antigonos Monophthalmos' achievements Billows has argued convincingly that his role as a colonizer has tended to be overshadowed by the Seleucid program.<a name="fnd0e4603-ref" href="#fnd0e4603" data-tei-tag="ref">69</a> He points out that we know of three cases—ANTIGONEIA Troas, in Bithynia, and on the Orontes—where Antigonos' settlement was later refounded. He suggests—quite reasonably—that colonies of Antigonos may have been behind many of the Seleucid settlements. There is merit in Billows's objection in favor of Antigonos as a major colonizer. We should, after all, expect that he would have built colonies in Asia Minor as well as in Asia. The difficulty is, as he points out, the lack of evidence. In Asia Minor we know Antigonos was especially active on the west coast. Thus we find ANTIGONEIA Troas, the reestablishment of Smyrna as EURYDIKEIA, the enlargement of KOLOPHON, and Antigonos' plans for the synoecism of Teos and Lebedos. Turning to the interior regions of Asia Minor, where incidentally his rule</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_44" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">44</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_44"></div>
          <p>was remembered with great nostalgia (Plut. <i class="italic">Phocion</i> 29.1), we are faced with a lack of unequivocal evidence for any kind of colony founding activity by him. This contrasts sharply with the extensive evidence for Seleucid activity in the region (see below). How many of these Seleucid settlements originated as foundations of Antigonos (or of Lysimachos) is unknown. There is also evidence for colonies of Macedonians in Lydia and Phrygia. In practically all these cases, as, for example, at NAKRASON, the founder is not known. In any event it is unlikely that Monophthalmos, who never ruled Macedonia and who was hostile to Kassandros, would have been able to recruit actively there. He could, of course, recruit Greek soldiers from Asia Minor and the regions in Greece under his control. But the only Macedonians he could recruit were those already in Asia Minor and Asia. On the other hand, Antiochos I and II, by virtue of their friendliness with Antigonos Gonatas, would have had far easier access to Macedonia. In short the available evidence makes clear that the Seleucids were very active founding settlements in the interior of Asia Minor. It says nothing about a similar Antigonid effort.</p>
          <p>There were, of course, other means available to control an area. According to Plutarch (<i class="italic">Eum</i> . 3-7), when Eumenes was appointed satrap over Cappadocia he distributed cities to his friends, left behind judges (<i class="italic">dikastai</i> ) and administrators (<i class="italic">dioiketai</i> ), and appointed garrison commanders. Undoubtedly Antigonos followed a similar path in ruling Asia Manor. I have referred elsewhere to the evidence for the presence of Antigonid garrisons on the south coast of Asia Minor. We might note in passing that there is also evidence for garrisons throughout Phoenicia (Diod. 19.59.2, 61.5, 86.1), at Ephesos (20.111.3) and Korinth (20.103.3), and at other cities and fortresses (19.85.5), and, finally, that Stephanos (s.v. "Antigoneia") refers to the Kyzikene ANTIGONEIA as a "fortress." And Ptolemy was quite willing to accuse Antigonos of having occupied some Greek cities with garrisons (Diod. 20.19.3). In the interior of Asia Minor the epigraphic evidence for garrisons is very slight: one attestation in Caria and one on the Pisidian/Lycian frontier.<a name="fnd0e4636-ref" href="#fnd0e4636" data-tei-tag="ref">70</a> We may well expect that there were other Antigonid garrisons elsewhere in the interior. Aside from garrisons the Antigonids conld also maintain a presence by granting land to individuals. Thus the well-known Mnesimachos inscription records the granting of a large estate in the plain of Sardis by Antigonos (presumably this is the king) to Mnesimachos.<a name="fnd0e4649-ref" href="#fnd0e4649" data-tei-tag="ref">71</a> It also mentions <i class="italic">kleroi</i> , or land lots, on it, and</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_45" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">45</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_45"></div>
          <p>the names of two holders of part of the estate, Pytheos and Adrastos.<a name="fnd0e4686-ref" href="#fnd0e4686" data-tei-tag="ref">72</a> And earlier, in 316 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , Antigonos had used the promise of gifts of land as an inducement to soldiers of Eumenes to desert (Diod. 19.25.3). The granting of land for settlement to individual soldiers is found elsewhere in Asia Minor. For example, Eupolemos may have given land to individual colonists who then settled around PENTACIHORA in Caria.</p>
          <p>Following Antigonos' defeat at Ipsos in 301 Lysimachos gained control of central and western Asia Minor. Then in 296/5 he was able to seize the west coast of Asia Minor from Demetrios Poliorketes. The extant evidence for Lysimachos' colonizing activity in Asia Minor is strikingly similar to what I have already noted for Antigonos: while we know of Lysimachos' colonizing activity along the coast—for example, ALEXANDREIA Troas, ILION, ARSINOE Ephesos, EURYDIKEIA Smyrna—we have no evidence that he built any foundations in Lydia or Phrygia.</p>
          <p>A problem for the Seleucids was how to maintain access to their western possessions. The sea was not a real possibility. The Seleucid navy was weak and no match for the Ptolemaic fleet. Furthermore, the Ptolemies controlled much of the Aegean until the middle of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Finally, as I have noted, the west coast ports were not always in Seleucid hands. The only means of keeping contact with western Asia Minor, therefore, was by land.</p>
          <p>In antiquity there were a number of major highways linking the Aegean coast of Asia Minor with the East. The first, the famous "Royal Road" of the Persian Empire, began in the Hermos River valley. Another, farther south, ran through the Maeander River valley. This is the road Strabo, citing Artemidorus (fl. 104 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), refers to as the "Common Road" used by all who traveled from Ephesos to the East (14.2.29). It was the main trade route across Asia Minor in the Hellenistic period. Strabo says the road passed through Magnesia on the Maeander, (SELEUKEIA) Tralleis, NYSA, ANTIOCH on the Maeander, LAODIKEIA on the Lykos, APAMEIA Kelainai, METROPOLIS, Holmoi, PHILOMELION, LAODIKEIA Katakekaumene, Mazaka (EUSEBEIA near Argaios) in Cappadocia, and on toward Mesopotamia. The southern trunk line of the road branched off beyond Laodikeia to Ikonion and Kybistra and then passed through the Cilician Gates into Cilicia. This is also the road, incidentally, that Cicero took in 51 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> when he traveled from Ephesos to Tarsos. Cicero provides an itinerary of the trip in the course of some of his letters to Atticus. He departed from Ephesos in late July and stopped at, among other places, Tralleis, Laodikeia, Apameia, Synnada, Philomelion, Ikonion,</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_46" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">46</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_46"></div>
          <p>and Kybistra before arriving at Tarsos in early October.<a name="fnd0e4724-ref" href="#fnd0e4724" data-tei-tag="ref">73</a> The presence of so many colonies along this east-west axis makes clear their primary purpose: to guard and take advantage of the trade route from Mesopotamia and Syria to the western coast of Asia Minor. It also explains Seleukos I Nikator's concern for building a stable presence in Cilicia: the Cilician Gates provided the major access to the Common Road.</p>
          <p>By 274 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> there definitely was a colony at THYATEIRA. A dedication dated to the thirty-seventh year of the Seleucid era has been found there. Furthermore another inscription records a dedication by the Macedonian officers and soldiers to King Seleukos (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 211), who was undoubtedly the founder, as Stephanos says (s.v. "Thyateira"). However, other inscriptions from Thyateira, which, incidentally, also record the presence of Macedonians, have been dated palaeographically to the end of the fourth century. If this dating is correct, we might have evidence for colonists in Lydia that could be connected with Antigonos, or, drawing it down a bit, with Lysimachos. But this line of investigation is hypothetical and, in any event, provides our only possible indication of pre-Seleucid colonizing activity in Lydia. Furthermore at HYRKANIS there was a Macedonian colony where the descendants of the colonists worshipped Zeus Seleukeios. There is, in fact, a great deal of evidence attesting the existence of colonies of Macedonians in Lydia. In addition to the two colonies I have already noted I would mention AGATHEIRA, APOLLONIS, DOIDYE, -ESPOURA, KOBEDYLE, and PHILADELPHEIA as well as AKRASOS, MAKEDONES, MYSOMAKEDONES, and NAKRASON. None of these are attested in the period of Seleucid rule. The first six are known in the Attalid period, the last four under Roman rule. For two, Apollonis and Philadelpheia, we have specific testimony that they were founded by the Attalids. For the others there is no indication of the founder. However, it is a reasonable working hypothesis that they were originally established by the Seleucids or their predecessors rather than the Pergamenes.<a name="fnd0e4740-ref" href="#fnd0e4740" data-tei-tag="ref">74</a> It is interesting that the two settlements whose founders we know were cities. The others were smaller colonies. Presumably, like Thyateira, many were originally organized on military lines. Later on, some of them, like KOBEDYLE, apparently became part of existing cities.</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_47" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">47</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_47"></div>
          <p>The smaller, mainly rural colonies are attested primarily in western Asia Minor: in Lydia and, to a lesser degree, in the neighboring regions. In contrast, settlements with dynastic names are surprisingly rare in Lydia. I count only three: the two Attalid cities mentioned earlier and STRATONIKEIA. The latter is the only settlement in Lydia with a dynastic name that may possibly be ascribed to the Seleucids. If, as is reasonable to assume, a dynastic name is one of the indications of polis status for a colony, then we are faced with the possibility that the Seleucids founded, at the most, only one settlement in Lydia that became a city. This contrasts sharply with their activity in the neighboring areas of Caria and Phrygia. In the former we encounter two ANTIOCHS (Alabanda and on the Maeander), NYSA, SELEUKEIA Tralleis, STRATONIKEIA, and APOLLONIA Salbake. In the latter we find ANTIOCH near Pisidia, APAMEIA Kelainai, and LAODIKEIA on the Lykos. Farther away, in Pisidia, Pamphylia, and Cilicia we also find settlements with dynastic names.</p>
          <p>The direct evidence for Seleucid settlements in Lydia is rather sparse. PALAIMAGNESIA and the JEWISH COLONIES dispatched by Antiochos III are the only colonies in Lydia we can unequivocally ascribe to the Seleucids. There is a strong probability that THYATEIRA, HYRKANIS, and MAGNESIA near Sipylos were Seleucid; in addition, STRATONIKEIA was possibly also founded by the Seleucids. Finally, we should recall that after destroying part of SARDIS for its support of Achaios, Antiochos III rebuilt it. Sardis is, incidentally, the only Lydian city that had a Seleucid mint.<a name="fnd0e4758-ref" href="#fnd0e4758" data-tei-tag="ref">75</a></p>
          <p>As for the Attalids we may note, in addition to the colonies mentioned above, the PANTHEOTAI and LASNEDDA, as well as ATTALEIA and MERNOUPHYTA. The latter two are, along with PHILADELPHEIA and APOLLONIS, the only settlements in Lydia that can be definitely attributed to them. The difficulty for us is determining how many of the settlements first attested under the Attalids were founded by them, rather than inherited from the Seleucids or their predecessors in the area. As I have mentioned, probability favors their having been inherited. But this is only probability.</p>
          <p>In Phrygia we know of at least four Seleucid foundations: LAODIKEIA on the Lykos, HIERAPOLIS, APAMEIA Kelainai, and ANTIOCH near Pisidia. The importance of Apameia—and, hence, of Phrygia—to the Seleucids is clear from the fact that they maintained a palace there. In addition there were numerous settlements that have yielded evidence for the presence of Macedonians: for example, BLAUNDOS, DOKIMEION, DORYLAION, HIERAPOLIS,</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_48" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">48</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_48"></div>
          <p>LAODIKEIA on the Lykos, METROPOLIS, and PELTAI. The problem is that all the attestations date from the Imperial period, long after the age of Hellenistic colonization. In fact there is no extant Hellenistic evidence for Macedonians in Phrygia.<a name="fnd0e4796-ref" href="#fnd0e4796" data-tei-tag="ref">76</a> Undoubtedly some of these Macedonians were descended from Seleucid colonists. Unfortunately, however, there is no evidence available to confirm this.</p>
          <p>It is interesting—and potentially useful—to plot the locations of the settlements on a map. I have already noted the numerous colonies founded along the great trade route that ran from Ephesos to Cilicia and Mesopotamia. In Lydia there were a number of north-south roads.<a name="fnd0e4803-ref" href="#fnd0e4803" data-tei-tag="ref">77</a> The importance of one such road is clearly seen from the major settlements along its path: the road, which began in the Hellespont at Kyzikos, ran past STRATONIKEIA, close to ATTALEIA, then to THYATEIRA, SARDIS, PHILADEL-PHEIA, and HIERAPOLIS before joining the Common Road at LAODIKEIA on the Lykos.</p>
          <p>The proximity of many colonies to each other has prompted some scholars to suggest that certain Attalid settlements were built with an eye to particular Seleucid colonies. For example, W. M. Ramsay long ago suggested that the Pergamene settlements were often sited over against Seleucid foundations; thus he claimed that APOLLONIA in Mysia "answered to" NAKRASA (<i class="italic">sic</i> ), ATTALEIA to THYATEIRA, DIONYSOPOLIS to BLAUNDOS, EUMENEIA to PELTAI, APOLLONIA in Phrygia to SELEUKEIA in Pisidia, and that APOLLONIS was on the site of DOIDYE.<a name="fnd0e4810-ref" href="#fnd0e4810" data-tei-tag="ref">78</a> This reconstruction is rather neat. Unfortunately it does not always stand up under scrutiny. Thus Apollonia in Mysia was probably not a Hellenistic colony. There are also serious questions regarding the founders of Nakrason and Akrasos, Blaundos, Peltai, and Apollonia in Phrygia. Furthermore, after 188 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> the Attalid empire encompassed most of western Asia Minor. As a result, the settlements built by Eumenes II and Attalos II did not have to answer the same strategic concerns as many of the earlier Seleucid colonies. In addition, Louis Robert has demonstrated that whereas the Seleucid colonies were founded for strategic reasons, the Pergamene settlements, such as ATTALEIA, were in areas of great fertility but of little strategic value.<a name="fnd0e4817-ref" href="#fnd0e4817" data-tei-tag="ref">79</a> According to Robert, they were not fortresses guarding a particular region or road. Rather they were rural centers founded simply in order to give fertile land to settlers (Polyb. 5.78.5).</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_49" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">49</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_49"></div>
          <p>Despite this criticism of Ramsay one must grant that, in theory, he was not completely wrong. Nor is there an inherent contradiction with Robert. Undoubtedly some of the Attalid colonies were built with an eye to a Seleucid counterpart, past or present, and vice versa. Unfortunately in many cases, especially in connection with the colonies of Macedonians, we cannot identify the founder or the founding dynasty. Nevertheless we must bear in mind that the very factor(s) that induced one monarch to establish a colony in a particular area could induce another to do the same. Attaleia and Apollonis may not have been in the most strategically advantageous places, but they were located in the same region as Thyateira, Nakrason, and Akrasos. Surely the Attalids were aware of this when they chose the sites. After all, they had inherited a land empire dotted with colonists who had been loyal to the Seleucid royal house. With all of Lydia and Phrygia under Attalid control it was not necessary to seize the most strategic places. On the other hand, it was necessary to establish an Attalid presence in various regions that had only recently passed from Seleucid to Pergamene rule. This probably explains, for example, the decision to found PHILADELPHEIA and EUMENEIA. In short, many of the Attalid settlements <i class="italic">were</i> founded to give good land to settlers. At the same time the choice of location suggests that the Attalids were also aware of the need to maintain a presence in certain areas and near certain former Seleucid colonies. Finally, there were other cases where the same foundation was built by one dynast and later refounded by another. I have already mentioned the case of ANTIGONEIA/ALEXANDREIA Troas and ANTIGONEIA/NIKAIA in Bithynia. This was also apparently the case with HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia, which benefited from both Seleucid and Pergamene attention. Hierapolis was, of course, a major religious center. It made sense, therefore, that the Attalids would want to lavish as much attention on it as their predecessors.</p>
          <p>I have mentioned elsewhere the presence of colonies in Phrygia that were probably founded by independent dynasts. In this connection we might also note the evidence for Pergamene activity in Phrygia. The Attalids did not come into permanent possession of Phrygia until after the Peace of Apameia in 188 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> It will not be surprising, therefore, that we know of only two Pergamene settlements there: FUMENEIA and DIONYSOPOLIS.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">The Southern Coast of Asia Minor</i> . Earlier I mentioned the contrasting situation in the interior of Asia Minor as regards the absence of evidence for Antigonid colonies and the wealth of evidence for Seleucid settlements. A similar state of affairs is to be found on the southern coast. In the third century the Ptolemies and the Seleucids were both very active founding colonies along</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_50" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">50</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_50"></div>
          <p>the south coast of Asia Minor. Colonies of the former are to be found on the coast of Rough (i.e., western) Cilicia, Pamphylia, Lycia, and probably Caria as well. On the other hand, evidence for Seleucid colonies is primarily limited to Smooth (i.e., eastern) Cilicia and the eastern part of Rough Cilicia, as well as Pamphylia. In contrast there is no evidence that Antigonos Monophthalmos established colonies on the south coast of Asia Minor.</p>
          <p>As a result of his shipbuilding program in 314 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Diod. 19.58.1-4) Antigonos was a major naval power in the eastern Mediterranean. In order to maintain his rule over the southern coast and to service his ships he apparently relied on various coastal towns where there were garrisons or shipyards. For example, Diodorus tells us that Antigonos established shipyards at Tripolis, Byblos, and Sidon in Phoenicia in order to take advantage of the forests of Lebanon, and in Cilicia, and that he also made use of one on the island of Rhodes. Regarding the Cilician and Rhodian shipyards, Diodorus says that timber from the Tauros Mountains was used for the former and was imported for the latter (19.58.4-5). In addition we know that Theodotos, Antigonos' admiral, sailed with his fleet from Patara in Lycia in 315 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Diod. 19.64.5) and that Demetrios Poliorketes put in at a Cilician harbor in 307 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> before crossing over to Cyprus (Diod. 20.47.1; cf. 20.93.4). As for garrisons, it is interesting to note that despite his repeated declarations supporting the freedom and autonomy of the Greeks Antigonos apparently maintained garrisons in a number of Cilician cities (20.19.3-5). We also know of garrisons in Kaunos in Carla and Xanthos in Lycia (Diod. 20.27. 1-2). Presumably others existed as well. On the other hand, there is no evidence for colonizing by Antigonos along the south coast. This contrasts sharply with the situation under the Ptolemies.</p>
          <p>In the period before the battle of Ipsos in 301 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Antigonos and Demetrios contended vigorously with Ptolemy I for control of the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean basin. In the continuing and often confused struggle Ptolemy gained and lost numerous territories. Thus he conquered Syria and Phoenicia in 320 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> only to lose it in 315 to Antigonos.<a name="fnd0e4876-ref" href="#fnd0e4876" data-tei-tag="ref">80</a> After his defeat of Demetrios Poliorketes in 312 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> at Gaza Ptolemy was able, temporarily, to retake Palestine; shortly afterward, however, he yielded it once again to Demetrios and Antigonos (Diod. 19.93-94; Plut. <i class="italic">Demetr</i> . 6.3). In 310 he took control</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_51" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">51</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_51"></div>
          <p>of Cyprus (Diod. 20.21) but lost it to Demetrios in 306 (Plut. <i class="italic">Demetr</i> . 15-16; Diod. 20.47-53). In 309 he captured various cities on the Lycian and Carian coast and the island Kos (Diod. 20.27.1-2). In the same year he took some Cilician cities but soon lost them (Diod. 20.19.4 and 27.1). In 308 he sent a large expedition to the Peloponnese, but, having failed to rally the Greeks to his side, he departed, leaving garrisons in Sikyon and Korinth (Diod. 20.37.2).<a name="fnd0e4928-ref" href="#fnd0e4928" data-tei-tag="ref">81</a></p>
          <p>Ipsos radically changed the situation. Antigonos' land empire was divided among the victors. And even though Demetrios still controlled the League of the Islanders and Cyprus as well as various coastal towns in Greece, Asia Minor, and Phoenicia, his star was waning. Ptolemy was quite ready to chip away at the few remaining possessions of Demetrios' sundering empire. Though Ptolemy did not fight at Ipsos, he seized control of southern Syria as his share of the spoils (Diod. 21.1.5). This was to remain under Egyptian hegemony until 200 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Then in 294 he retook Cyprus, and after 287 he seized the League of the Islanders.<a name="fnd0e4935-ref" href="#fnd0e4935" data-tei-tag="ref">82</a> Egypt now had significant territory in the Aegean and was a major presence in the eastern Mediterranean. And like the nineteenth-century British Empire, which focused; much of its effort on assuring a safe passage to India, so the Ptolemies needed to ensure that they had a safe and reliable passage to the Aegean and to Greece. For this they needed a strong navy and ports of call to service the fleet. This was the basis of the Ptolemaic policy to found colonies throughout the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean—in Cyprus, Crete, Keos, the Argolid, and along the southern coast of Asia Minor. For just as, according to Libanius (<i class="italic">Or</i> . 11.100), Seleucid colonies served the needs of travelers along the main trade routes, so these Ptolemaic colonies served the needs of the Egyptian fleet.</p>
          <p>The Ptolemies' need to colonize and control as much of the coast of Asia Minor as possible inevitably brought them into conflict with the Seleucids. In discussing the history of the conflicts between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies historians tend to concentrate their attention on the fight for control of Syria, the so-called Syrian Wars that were fought intermittently throughout the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> To some degree this has diverted modern attention from another contest that was going on at the same time: the struggle over the control of the western and southern coast of Asia Minor. Our evidence for this is particularly scrappy; but what is clear is that the two royal houses were as tenacious in their desire to rule these regions as they were to dominate Coele-Syria. And one way of maintaining control was to establish colonies in the area. Control of Cilicia and Pamphylia alternated between the Seleucids and Ptolemies throughout</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_52" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">52</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_52"></div>
          <p>much of the third century. However, because of the poor evidence it is not always possible to specify the precise holdings of either dynasty at a given time. According to Theocritus (17.88-89) Ptolemy II Philadelphos' overseas possessions included Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia, and Cilicia. According to the Adoulis inscription (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 54) Ptolemy III Euergetes I inherited, among other regions, Caria and Lycia from his father but conquered Pamphylia and Cilicia in his own right. Euergetes' claim to have conquered Cilicia is also mentioned by Hieronymus (<i class="italic">FGrH</i> 260 F43). There is no necessary contradiction between the various sources. It is possible, after all, that Philadelphos lost some overseas territory that Euergetes subsequently reconquered. In any event, Ptolemaic control over much of the southern coast effectively came to an end in 197 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> when, according to Hieronymus, Antiochos III captured the following places from Ptolemy V: Selinos, Anemourion, Zephyrion, Aphrodisias, Korykos, Soloi, and Mallos in Cilicia as well as Xanthos, Patara, Andriake, and Limyra in Lycia.<a name="fnd0e4978-ref" href="#fnd0e4978" data-tei-tag="ref">83</a></p>
          <p><i class="italic">Caria</i> . Antigonos Monophthalmos first came into possession of Caria in 312, when he overcame the Macedonian satrap, Asandros. Although it remained under his rule until the battle of Ipsos, various coastal sites did, at one time or another in the last decade of the fourth century, fall to Ptolemaic attacks or ally themselves with the Egyptians. For example, Kaunos was occupied by Ptolemaic troops in 309 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> (Diod. 20.27.2). Around the same time IASOS was allied with Ptolemy, and in 308 Myndos served as a port of embarkation for the Egyptian fleet on its way to the Peloponnese.<a name="fnd0e4991-ref" href="#fnd0e4991" data-tei-tag="ref">84</a> After Ipsos, Pleistarchos, the brother of Kassandros, came into possession of Caria. In the short time that he controlled the area, namely, from 301 until 295 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , he built at least one settlement, the eponymous PLEISTARCHEIA. We do not know the precise limits of Pleistarchos' princedom. Apparently it was confined to central Caria, encompassing the area of Mylasa to Hyllarima. Billows has argued convincingly that around 295/4 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> Pleistarchos' territory came under attack from the north by Lysimachos and from the south by Ptolemy I.<a name="fnd0e5021-ref" href="#fnd0e5021" data-tei-tag="ref">85</a> He has</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_53" class="page-break-container">

            <hr id="JD_Page_53"></div>
          <p>also suggested that the dynast Eupolemos succeeded to control of this region and that he remained in power from about 294 until 286 or 280 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Seleukos Nikator's victory over Lysimachos at Korupedion in 281 brought the Seleucids to Caria.</p>
          <p>There were a number of Seleucid settlements in northern and central Caria: ANTIOCH on the Maeander, NYSA, SELEUKEIA Tralleis, ANTIOCH Alabanda, APOLLONIA Salbake, and STRATONIKEIA. The factors underlying the decision to found these settlements are not far to seek. I have already noted that the first three were located in the Maeander River valley on the Common Road. Furthermore Apollonia Salbake, Nysa, Seleukeia Tralleis, and Stratonikeia were located at the site of or close to important religious centers. Finally, there was the Ptolemaic threat. On most of the southern littoral of Asia Minor the Ptolemies apparently confined themselves to the coastal regions. Caria is one of the few regions in southern Asia Minor, along with Lycia, where we have evidence for the Ptolemies penetrating significantly into the interior.<a name="fnd0e5065-ref" href="#fnd0e5065" data-tei-tag="ref">86</a> For example, a Ptolemaic inscription (<i class="italic">I. Strat</i> . 1002) from the area of STRATONIKEIA is dated to the year 274 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (six years later it was under Seleucid domination: probably an accurate reflection of the tension between the two dynasties in Caria and their constant jockeying for control). And a decree of the Chrysaoric League (<i class="italic">I. Labraunda</i> 43), dated to the nineteenth year of King Ptolemy (i.e., 267 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), indicates that at the time Labraunda and MYLASA were under Ptolemaic rule. There is also evidence for AMYZON under Ptolemaic rule: a decree from AMYZON is dated to the ninth year of Ptolemy Philadelphos.<a name="fnd0e5074-ref" href="#fnd0e5074" data-tei-tag="ref">87</a> Later, at the very end of the third century, Antiochos III took control of Amyzon. The transition can be seen in a letter of Antiochos to Amyzon, written in 203 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , which promises to maintain the privileges that had previously been granted when the city was in the Ptolemaic alliance.<a name="fnd0e5084-ref" href="#fnd0e5084" data-tei-tag="ref">88</a> The changeover apparently resulted in some dislocation. In 201 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> the Seleucid epistates, Menestratos, arranged for the repopulation of the Artemision at Amyzon. Despite the extensive evidence for a Ptolemaic presence in the interior of Caria, only one Egyptian colony is attested, PTOLEMAIS. Like many other Ptolemaic colonies, it was probably located on the coast. Finally, a recently published inscription suggests that Euromos may</p>

          <p>have been renamed PHILIPPOI by Philip V during his Carian expedition of 201/200 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span></p>
          <p><i class="italic">Lycia</i> . The Ptolemaic presence in Lycia is attested as early as 309 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Diod. 20.27.1-2).<a name="fnd0e5145-ref" href="#fnd0e5145" data-tei-tag="ref">89</a> Inscriptions, many of which have been discovered in the last two decades, provide extensive evidence for Egyptian control of Lycia throughout much of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
            <a name="fnd0e5155-ref" href="#fnd0e5155" data-tei-tag="ref">90</a> We know of two Ptolemaic foundations in Lycia, ARSINOE Patara and PHILOTERA. The former was, like other Arsinoes, a coastal city with a harbor. A decree of the inland city of Araxa bears what is apparently a Ptolemaic date.<a name="fnd0e5222-ref" href="#fnd0e5222" data-tei-tag="ref">91</a> In this connection it is worth noting that whereas for much of southern Asia Minor Ptolemaic control was generally limited to the coastal regions, in Lycia as well as Caria it extended inland. Apparently there was also a Seleucid colony, the KARDAKON KOME, in Lycia; it was probably founded by Antiochos III after he occupied the area in 197 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span></p>
          <p><i class="italic">Pamphylia</i> . The situation of Pamphylia in the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> is particularly difficult to clarify. Theocritus (17.88) lists Parnphylia among the possessions of Ptolemy II Philadelphos. Furthermore Philadelphos appointed a Pamphyli[arch] over the area in 278 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
            <a name="fnd0e5232-ref" href="#fnd0e5232" data-tei-tag="ref">92</a> However, since Ptolemy III claimed Pamphylia as one of his conquests (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 54.14), it is probable that (part or all of) the territory had been lost and recaptured. Later, in 218, the usurper Achaios overran most of Pamphylia (Polyb. 5.77.1), effectively ending Ptolemaic rule in the region. In 213 Achaios was captured and executed by Antiochos III. Presumably at that time Achaios' holdings were turned over to Antiochos. In any event, Hieronymus' list of cities conquered by Antiochos in 197 records Lycian and Cilician towns but omits mention of any Pamphylian ones (<i class="italic">FGrH</i> 260 F46). The argument is admittedly <i class="italic">ex silentio</i> , but the possibility exists that</p>
          <div id="JD_Page_55" class="page-break-container">
            <div class="page-number">55</div>
            <hr id="JD_Page_55"></div>
          <p>Hieronymus' silence reflects the fact that the Pamphylian cities had already transferred and maintained their allegiance to Antiochos. It should be emphasized, however, that our evidence is so scrappy that it is not possible to indicate precisely the duration or the extent of Ptolemaic or Seleucid rule in Pamphylia. There was an ARSINOE (as well as a PTOLEMAIS) in Pamphylia, and, according to Strabo (14.5.3), it was located near an area that supplied shipbuilding timber used by Cleopatra VII. Undoubtedly her predecessors also exploited this resource and founded Arsinoe in that connection. There were, in addition to the Ptolemaic foundations in Pamphylia, a SELEUKEIA and an ATTALEIA (the modern Antalya). The location of the latter should be noted. As a result of the Peace of Apameia in 188 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> the Attalids had come into possession of a large part of Asia Minor. However, as M. Holleaux has pointed out, the liberated Greek cities on the western coast of Asia Minor limited Eumenes II's access to the Aegean.<a name="fnd0e5269-ref" href="#fnd0e5269" data-tei-tag="ref">93</a> AS a result the king was particularly concerned about having outlets on the south coast. Attaleia provided that outlet. Its precise founding date is, however, unknown.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">Cilicia</i> . I have already mentioned that in 314 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Antigonos Monophthalmos undertook a major shipbuilding program. As part of this effort he established a number of shipyards throughout the eastern Mediterranean (Diod. 19.58.1-4). He founded one in Cilicia because of the timber from the nearby Tauros Mountains. Furthermore, before Demetrios Poliorketes set out on his expedition to Cyprus in 307 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> he put in at Cilicia in order to assemble additional soldiers and ships (Diod. 20.47.1). We do not know, however, where his fleet anchored or where his father built his ships.</p>
          <p>For the Seleucids possession of Cilicia was extremely important, because it controlled access to the land route from Syria to central and western Asia Minor. Seleucid concern over this region can clearly be seen in their colonizing activity both in the early third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and again in the first part of the second century. In the first part of the third century Seleukos I Nikator founded SELEUKEIA on the Kalykadnos. As the existence of ANTIOCH on the Kydnos is first attested in the mid-third century the possibility arises that it, too, was founded by Nikator. It is also possible that ANTIOCH on the Pyramos was established in the third century. One is led to wonder, therefore, if Seleukos was trying to establish a Seleucid presence in Cilicia with these (and other?) settlements in much the same way as he was anchoring a Seleucid presence in</p>

          <p>northern Syria with Antioch on the Orontes, Seleukeia in Pieria, Laodikeia by the Sea, and Apameia.</p>
          <p>Later, in the second century, Antiochos IV Epiphanes turned his attention to the area. While no settlement in the area can definitely be attributed to him it is possible that he founded or refounded ANTIOCH on the Saros, EPIPHANEIA Oiniandos, HIERAPOLIS Castabala, and SELEUKEIA on the Pyramos. These (re)foundations were probably little more than formal renamings. Despite that it is interesting to find Epiphanes attempting to emulate his ancestors. It certainly would have made sense for Antiochos to try to reinvigorate a Seleucid presence in the area. By the time he came to the throne the Seleucid empire had shrunk to a fraction of its original size. Hence it is quite understandable that Antiochos would want to reassert a Seleucid presence in part of the territory still subject to his rule.</p>
          <p>In the Greek mind Cilicia was geographically on the eastern extremity of Asia Minor. When Isocrates recommended to Philip that he colonize Asia Minor he described the area as "Asia from Cilicia to Sinope—as some say" (<i class="italic">Philip</i> 120).<a name="fnd0e5303-ref" href="#fnd0e5303" data-tei-tag="ref">94</a> For the overland traveler moving eastward the passage through the Clilician Gates opened the way to Syria and regions farther east. In fact it is in Cilicia that we have our first evidence for a settlement named for a Macedonian or Greek town. AIOEAI on the Cilician coast was undoubtedly given the name of the old Macedonian capital. This practice, of course, becomes prevalent in Syria and throughout Asia. Nevertheless it is noteworthy that no examples of this kind of toponym are attested in Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains.</p>
          <p>For the Ptolemies Cilicia had definite attractions. From the strategic point of view control of the region meant the ability to cut off the Seleucids from a vital east-west route. Equally important was the shipbuilding timber that Cilicia, along with Pamphylia, supplied. Ready access to shipbuilding material was obviously of the highest importance to the Ptolemies, who were trying to control an overseas empire with a large navy and yet ruled a state that was virtually devoid of timber. In addition to material, Cilicia was also a source of manpower. One sees frequent references, for example, to Cilicians in Ptolemaic garrisons in Clyprus.<a name="fnd0e5310-ref" href="#fnd0e5310" data-tei-tag="ref">95</a></p>
          <p>As a footnote to the Hellenistic settlements of Asia Minor one might mention the activity of Antiochos IV of Commagene. Commagene became</p>

          <p>an independent kingdom around 162 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> when it successfully rebelled against the Seleucids. In its checkered history it was by turns annexed and freed by the Romans. Its last king was the energetic Antiochos IV, who came to the throne in 38 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> when Gaius restored its nominal independence. Having then been briefly deposed by Gaius, he regained the throne under Claudius and reigned until 72 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> The kingdom stretched from the Tauros Mountains to the Euphrates and was not highly urbanized. As in other native kingdoms of Asia Minor, villages and temples predominated. Nevertheless it is possible that Antiochos IV, following Hellenistic fashion, founded ANTIOCH on Kragos, among other settlements.<a name="fnd0e5369-ref" href="#fnd0e5369" data-tei-tag="ref">96</a></p>
          <p><i class="italic">Pisidia and Lycaonia</i> . After the battle of Korupedion both Pisidia and Lycaonia passed from Lysimachos to Seleukos I Nikator. The region was strategically very important, particularly as the Common Road ran through it. The extent of Seleucid control over the area, however, is unclear.</p>
          <p>In this region we can identify two Seleucid colonies, LAODIKEIA Katakekaumene and SELEUKEIA, and possibly a third, NEAPOLIS. J. D. Grainger, noting that LAODIKEIA and SELEUKEIA, along with APAMEIA Kelainai, APOLLONIA, and ANTIOCH, were located on the northern fringe of Pisidia, has suggested these settlements were founded in order to "enclose the Pisidians in a crescent of forts."<a name="fnd0e5384-ref" href="#fnd0e5384" data-tei-tag="ref">97</a> He is undoubtedly correct. Located as they were along the Common Road, these colonies both enclosed the Pisidians to the south and acted as bulwark against the Galatians to the north.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">Galatia</i> . There are no firmly attested Hellenistic colonies in Galatia.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">Cappadocia</i> . The Cappadocian royal house was descended from a satrapal family that had refused submission to Alexander. Around 260 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Ariaramnes, a grandson of the satrap Ariarathes, conquered Cappadocia. Then, around 255 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , his son Ariarathes III took the title of king. Like the Mithridatids, the Cappadocian kings generally followed a pro-Seleucid policy. Ariarathes III, for</p>

          <p>example, married a daughter of Antiochos II, while Ariarathes IV married a daughter of Antiochos III.<a name="fnd0e5440-ref" href="#fnd0e5440" data-tei-tag="ref">98</a> For the Seleucids Cappadocia occupied a strategic region astride the Common Road, which connected western Asia Minor with Mesopotamia (Strabo 14.2.29).</p>
          <p>We know of at least four cities that were founded by the Cappadocian monarchs.<a name="fnd0e5447-ref" href="#fnd0e5447" data-tei-tag="ref">99</a> Ariaramnes probably established the city named for himself. ARIARATHEIA was founded, according to Stephanos, by a relative of Anti-ochos. In addition Strabo (12.1.4) records two cities in Cappadocia: EUSEBEIA near Argaios, the former Mazaka, and EUSEBEIA near the Tauros, the former Tyana. Both were probably founded by the philhellene Ariarathes V Eusebes and have left evidence of developed civic institutions. Furthermore we should recall that Ariarathes V maintained a correspondence with the philosopher Carneades. Nevertheless most of Cappadocia remained relatively immune to urbanization and Hellenization. Strabo, for example, remarked that in his day the native language was still widely spoken (12.1.2).<a name="fnd0e5451-ref" href="#fnd0e5451" data-tei-tag="ref">100</a></p>
          <p><i class="italic">Northern Asia Minor</i> . Because of distance, the barrier presented by the Pontic Alps, and, after 278 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , the presence of the Gauls, the Seleucids were never able to get control of northern Asia Minor. The geopolitical situation in Hellenistic Asia Minor will, I believe, become clearer if we also consider the east-west highway system. It will be recalled that in the Hellenistic era the major east-west road was no longer the Royal Road, which began in the Hermos River valley, but rather the Common Road, which originated farther south in the Maeander valley (Strabo 14.2.29). The primary focus of east-west land travel in Asia Minor was from Syria to the Aegean littoral and back. Under the Republic and early Empire the Common Road and its western terminus, Ephesos, remained a vital link for communication with Rome. One can see that dearly in Cicero's itinerary of 51 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">Att</i> . 5.13-20).</p>
          <p>Under the later Empire trade with the Danube region increased. At the same time it became more important to maintain communication between the northern and eastern frontiers in order to expedite the movement of troops.<a name="fnd0e5458-ref" href="#fnd0e5458" data-tei-tag="ref">101</a> NIKOMEDEIA, which from the first century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> was called "Metropolis" and</p>

So it was that the major east-west route shifted northward again. The importance of Bithynia and Pontus was obviously far greater in the third century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> than in the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> If before, in the Hellenistic era, the strategic planning of the various kings had been centripetally focused on the Mediterranean, under the Roman Empire it was centrifugally directed away from the Mediterranean and toward the border regions. In this context Bithynia and Pontus assumed an importance under the Romans that they never had in the Hellenistic world. The willingness of Alexander and the successor kings to allow the northern kingdoms to go their own way certainly reflects the immense difficulties involved in controlling them. However, it probably also reflects strategic priorities that differed quite significantly from those facing the Roman emperors. In short, during the Hellenistic period the Mediterranean and the Aegean were still the central focus of strategic planning by all the major dynasties. As a result, Bithynia and Pontus were on the periphery and thus not as important strategically as they would later become.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">Pontus and Paphlagonia</i> . The ruling family of Pontus, the Mithridatids, claimed to be descended from Persian nobility. In 302 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Mithridates II, who was subject to Antigonos but was suspected of shifting his allegiance to Kassandros, was killed (Diod. 20.111.4). He was succeeded by Mithridates III. The latter, fearing Antigonos, fled to Kimiata, a fortress in Paphlagonia. Mithridates III, who ruled from 302 to 266 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , took the title "king" at some point in his reign, perhaps in 281 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C</span> as a result of the defeat of Seleukos Nikator's general, Diodoros (Pomp. Trog. <i class="italic">Prol</i> . 17), or as a result of the death of Lysimachos or Seleukos in that year.<a name="fnd0e5520-ref" href="#fnd0e5520" data-tei-tag="ref">103</a> Appian (<i class="italic">Mith</i> . 9) says that the Pontic Mithridates III took advantage of the preoccupation (</p>

          <p>Appian here was in fact referring to what we know as Pontus.<a name="fnd0e5561-ref" href="#fnd0e5561" data-tei-tag="ref">104</a> The history of the Pontic kingdom is one of gradual expansion over the northern coast of Asia Minor and southward into central Anatolia. Like the Cappadocian kings the Mithridatids generally cultivated goodwill with the Seleucids. Thus a daughter of Antiochos II married Mithridates II, a daughter of Mithridates II in turn married Antiochos III, and Pharnakes married Nysa, a granddaughter of Antiochos III.<a name="fnd0e5580-ref" href="#fnd0e5580" data-tei-tag="ref">105</a></p>
          <p>Pontus represents an interesting contrast with Bithynia. Despite the philhellenic tendencies of the royal house the country remained much less Hellenized and urbanized than Bithynia. The village, not the city, predominated, while temples exerted a major influence on the country. Whereas one can identify ten Hellenistic settlements in Bithynia, it is possible to recognize only four in Pontus; two were built by Mithridates VI Eupator. The earliest settlement was probably PHARNAKEIA toward the eastern extremity of the Pontic coast; presumably it was founded by Pharnakes I soon after he captured Sinope in 183 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Both EUPATORIA Amisos on the Black Sea and EUPATORIA Magnopolis in the interior were established by Mithridates VI. The founder of LAODIKEIA is not known. Finally, AMASTRIS, which was technically in Paphlagonia, was founded by Amastris, the wife of Dionysios of Herakleia and, later, of Lysimachos. After the battle of Korupedion it came into the possession of Mithridates III's son, Ariobarzanes.</p>
          <p>The Mithridatids were also active elsewhere. On the northern and western Black Sea coast Pharnakes established ties with Chersonesos in the Crimea and Odessos in Bulgaria. The only known Hellenistic foundation in the Ukraine was a fortress, EUPATORION, in the Crimean peninsula. It was built by Diophantos, a general of Mithridates Eupator. And in 86 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> the Pontic king founded a BERENIKE on Chios.</p>
          <p><i class="italic">Bithynia</i> . The kingdom of Bithynia originated in the peninsula of Kalchedon in northwest Asia Minor. The Bithynians themselves were of Thracian descent, warlike, xenophobic, and very independent. Xenophon remarks (<i class="italic">Anab</i> . 6.4.2) that they preyed on the shipwrecked and treated them with great cruelty. Neither the Persians nor Alexander was able to subjugate them completely. In 297/6, after successfully resisting Lysimachos, Zipoites took the title</p>

          <p>The history of the Bithynian kingdom is one of expansion, eastward toward Herakleia and Paphlagonia, southward toward the Mysian Mount Olympos, and westward toward the Propontis.<a name="fnd0e5626-ref" href="#fnd0e5626" data-tei-tag="ref">107</a> In the process of expanding, the Bithynians, particularly Nikomedes I and Prousias I, were active in founding settlements. Zipoites founded the eponymous ZIPOITION. His son and ultimate successor, Nikomedes I, founded NIKOMEDEIA on the Astakene Gulf. This foundation was particularly important because it gave the Bithynians access to the sea. Nikomedes was, of course, a great philhellene; the statue erected to him at Olympia attests his many benefactions (Paus. 5.12.7). Thus the founding of Nikomedeia was, like Peter the Great's founding of St. Petersburg, an act of major significance, commercially and culturally as well as politically. It is surely not coincidental that the Bithynian king cultivated good relations with Antigonos Gonatas and Ptolemy II Philadelphos, both of whom were among the executors of his will (Memnon, <i class="italic">FGrH</i> 434: F14). Nikomedeia's potential as a commercial center would have been severely stunted if shipping lanes to and from it ran through hostile waters. In this connection Rostovtzeff has called attention to a very illuminating document, the letter of Ziaëlas to Cos recognizing the inviolability Grits temple of Asklepios and promising protection to merchants from Kos (<i class="italic">RC</i> 25). I quote Rostovtzeff: "In this reply we read between the lines that he [i.e., Ziaëlas] perfectly understood the position of the Coans and the real aim of the embassy. He insists that he will follow the policy of his father and will remain faithful to his friendship and alliance with [Ptolemy III] Euergetes. His friendliness to the Coans was in fact an expression of his feelings towards Euergetes: 'and because King Ptolemy, our friend and ally, is well disposed towards you.' What the Coans, and behind them Ptolemy, really wanted to obtain from Ziaëlas was an assurance of his friendly and helpful attitude towards Greek merchants, who were ready to trade with him, provided they had this assurance. Ziaëlas replies quite explicitly. He assures the ambassadors that he takes good care 'of all Greeks who repair to us', and in express terms he guarantees complete safety to all sea-going folk who land in Bithynia or are wrecked on its coast. The general purport of his letter is clear. Come to Bithynia, he says, the time is past when Bithynian pirates used to molest merchants. The Bithynians are now friendly to strangers</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>As part of his eastward expansion Ziaëlas apparently founded an eponymous city, though probably not as far east as Cappadocia, as Stephanos (s.v. "Zela") says. His son, Prousias I, was especially active as a founder of cities. As a result of military assistance given to Philip V of Macedon in 202 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Prousias came into possession of Kios and Myrleia in Hellespontine Phrygia. These cities, which represented a further westward expansion, were refounded as PROUSIAS by the Sea and APAMEIA, respectively. Both of these gave the Bithynians even greater access to Aegean markets; they also allowed the Bithynians, with an eye to Pergamon, to establish a secure presence in the southern part of their kingdom. Early in the second century Prousias turned eastward and captured Kieros from Herakleia on the Pontos. He then renamed it after himself. Around the same time the king founded PROUSA in the southern part of his territory at the foot of the Mysian Mount Olympos, presumably to fortify his southern border against the Attalids. Finally, I should mention NIKAIA. It was obviously an important city. Nevertheless it is well to recall that it was not founded by the Bithynian dynasty. It was rather a foundation of Antigonos and Lysimachos that was inherited by the Bithynians.</p>
          <p>The experience of Bithynia in the Hellenistic period presents a good example of the function and the result of Hellenistic colonization. In the third and early second centuries <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> the Bithynian kingdom was expanding. And like the other Hellenistic monarchs the Bithynians used urban foundations as a means of controlling newly won territory. Frequently, in good Macedonian fashion, they named their foundations for themselves. As elsewhere in the Hellenistic world, different settlements served different purposes. Thus Nikomedeia was established primarily for political and economic reasons, while Prousa was founded with an eye to military needs. Furthermore, like settlements elsewhere in the Hellenistic world, these foundations were built on Greek models and became centers of Greek culture. In this way the economic, political, and strategic needs of the Bithynian kings melded with their philhellenism. The Bithynian achievement, however, may also serve as a good example of the limits of Hellenization, to use Momigliano's expression. We know about the cities that were founded and the Hellenization this implied. What we do not know is the degree to which this Hellenization penetrated the countryside. Evidence is almost completely lacking. Undoubtedly, however, the Bithynian villages remained untouched by this program of urbanization. In this, too,</p>

          <p>the Bithynian experience will have been similar to that of the other Hellenistic kings.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading-Heading3"><a href="#d0e3339" class="heading-link">The Purpose of the Settlements</a></h2>
        <p>What was the purpose of the various Hellenistic settlements in Europe and Asia Minor? We can distinguish military, economic, political, and administrative motives; of course in many cases these will have overlapped. Military considerations were dearly behind Philip's decision to send colonies to newly conquered parts of Thrace. According to Diodorus, "by founding strong cities at important places [Philip] stopped the rashness of the Thracians" (16.71.1-2). Polybius tells us that Alexander established a ring of Greek cities around Media in order to protect it from the neighboring barbarians (10.27). And Appian specifically says that Lysimachos founded Lysimacheia in Thrace as a bulwark against the Thracian menace (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 1). Internal security was the primary concern of Antiochos III when he sent Jewish colonists to Lydia and Phrygia. In the letter sent to Zeuxis setting out his plan, Antiochos writes: "It is necessary to give my very serious consideration to a revolt which I learn has broken out among the inhabitants of Lydia and Phrygia; and having consulted with my friends as to what should be done, I have decided to convey two thousand Jewish families with their effects from Mesopotamia and Babylonia to the garrisons and most important places" (Joseph. <i class="italic"> AJ</i> 12.149).</p>
        <p>The military significance of the settlements was twofold: <i class="italic"> (a)</i> they served as sources for recruits, and <i class="italic">(b)</i> they were frequently located at strategic sites. As for the recruitment of soldiers it will be recalled that, unlike Alexander, most of the Hellenistic monarchs could not bring over at will new recruits from Macedonia and Greece. By settling retired soldiers in colonies the kings were assuring a loyal presence at a particular place. And since the male children could be expected to do military service, they were also assuring the continued vitality of the army. G. T. Griffith and E Cumont have suggested that a military obligation was tied to the land lot settlers were given.<a name="fnd0e5693-ref" href="#fnd0e5693" data-tei-tag="ref">109</a> This was the case, for example, in Ptolemaic Egypt. However, for the Seleucid empire there is no explicit evidence to support the suggestion. Other theories have proposed that service in the Seleucid army was tied to regional conscription or membership in a fraternal association.<a name="fnd0e5703-ref" href="#fnd0e5703" data-tei-tag="ref">110</a> Whatever the nature of the military obligation,</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_64" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">64</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_64"></div>
        <p>it is clear that the descendants of the original settlers served in the Seleucid, Ptolemaic, and other Hellenistic armies.</p>
        <p>In addition to founding colonies for military purposes the kings also re-founded older cities at more defensible sites or strengthened existing defences. Demetrios Poliorketes did this at Sikyon, which he renamed DEMETRIAS. It is also possible that his father played a role in the enlargement of the city walls of KOLOPHON.<a name="fnd0e5736-ref" href="#fnd0e5736" data-tei-tag="ref">111</a></p>
        <p>The importance of the location of a settlement is clearly seen in Diodorus' description of Antigoneia on the Orontes (20.47.5). He says the site was "naturally suited for keeping watch over Babylon and the upper satrapies and again for [keeping watch over] Lower Syria and... Egypt" (trans. R. Greer). Diodorus' comment is interesting. Antigoneia was in northern Syria. Nevertheless he evaluates its importance in terms of the control it exercised over areas that were considerably removed. Overland access to them, however, was controlled by the new settlement. This is what Diodorus meant when he said Antigoneia "kept watch" over these regions. The same will have been true for other colonies. I have already mentioned the strategic location of settlements like ANTIPATREIA in Illyria, ANTIGONEIA in Epirus, PHILIPPOPOLIS, the renamed Phthiotic Thebes, and DEMETRIAS in Thessaly. As Strabo noted (9.5.15), the latter was a naval station; in addition it controlled both the Vale of Tempe and the mountains Pelion and Ossa. ARSINOE Methana, described by Louis Robert as "une base idéale à l'entrée du golfe Saronique, un petit Gibraltar," was an important Ptolemaic naval base, as were many of the Ptolemaic settlements.<a name="fnd0e5743-ref" href="#fnd0e5743" data-tei-tag="ref">112</a> ANTIOCH on the Maeander was on the Common Road that ran eastward from Ephesos to Phrygia and was the site of an important bridge that crossed the Maeander.</p>
        <p>The economic motive is implicit in Libanius' comment that Seleukos founded Antioch on the Orontes not just for enjoyment's sake but as a starting point in order that travelers could have cities instead of posthouses at which to stop (<i class="italic">Or</i> . 11.100). We are dealing here with commercial travelers, not tourists, and the reference is clearly to cities built along the major trade routes. Strabo, for example, called APAMEIA Kelainai "the great emporium of Asia" (12.8.15), and already in the early fourth century Xenophon could describe Tarsos, the later ANTIOCH on the Kydnos, as "large and prosperous" (<i class="italic">Anab</i> . 1.2.23).</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_65" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">65</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_65"></div>
        <p>Tarsos was at the Cilician terminus of the southern trunk of the Common Road, while APAMEIA Kelainai occupied an important point on the central section of the highway. The western terminus of this road, Ephesos, was, according to Strabo (14.1.24), the most important emporium in Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains. The protection and enhancement of trade routes, whether on land or sea, was obviously a vital factor in the choice of sites that were to be colonized. The many settlements along or near such routes makes that quite clear. Of course the site of some colonies will have been chosen in order to take advantage of a natural resource in the vicinity. For example, the Ptolemaic settlements on the Cilician and Pamphylian coast were important both because they served as ports of call and because of their proximity to timber-producing regions. Similarly the native timber of Cyprus contributed to the importance of the various ARSINOES on the island. In Phrygia, both DOKIMEION and SYNNDA were located near great marble quarries. Economic considerations could also play a major role in the decision to relocate a city. Thus when silting of the Kayster River had cut off Ephesos from the sea Lysimachos moved the inhabitants to a new location—the refounded ARSINOE—where a harbor could be built.</p>
        <p>In the administrative and political sphere it is interesting to note that a number of the foundations in Europe and Asia Minor are known to have been (or were intended to be) royal residences: DEMETRIAS in Thessaly, LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, Pergamon NIKOMEDEIA, ARSINOE Ephesos, EUPATORIA Amisos, and APAMEIA Kelainai. In fact Kelainai had been chosen by Alexander to be the capital of the satrapy of Phrygia. Furthermore the Attalids maintained a palace at Tralleis. EUSEBEIA near Argaios was the residence of a royal official, and ILION was the center of the Federation of the Troad. Finally, we should bear in mind that the creation or expansion of cities resulted in a commensurate reduction of royal land, simplifying the administrative burden on the central authorities. The larger urban units were also undoubtedly more economically viable.<a name="fnd0e5764-ref" href="#fnd0e5764" data-tei-tag="ref">113</a></p>
        <p>Temples and shrines were centers of influence and wealth. The donations Hellenistic monarchs made to various festivals, the recognition as "crowned" or inviolable that they gave to festivals and temples, all attest to this. Such donations were another means, incidentally, by which the king could proclaim and advertise his philhellenism. Thus, in the course of recognizing the inviolability of the temple of Asklepios at Kos, Ziaëlas of Bithynia wrote to the Koans that "we pay attention to all the Greeks who come to us since we believe that this contributes in no small way to one's reputation" (<i class="italic">RC</i> 25. 11-17).</p>

          <hr id="JD_Page_66"></div>
        <p>It is not surprising, therefore, to find that many of the Hellenistic settlements were built at or near major religious centers or were the sites of especially well known temples. Thus ANTIOCH near Pisidia, APOLLONIA Salbake, and SELEUKEIA on the Kalykadnos were all near well-known religious centers. ILION was home to an important temple of Athena, Ephesos (ARSINOE) was famous for its temple of Artemis, and KOLOPHON had within its territory Klaros and the oracle of Apollo.<a name="fnd0e5792-ref" href="#fnd0e5792" data-tei-tag="ref">114</a></p>
        <p>Thus far I have not alluded to Hellenization as a motive because I do not think any of the kings had that as a primary consideration. It is true, of course, that in his speech to the Macedonians at Opis Alexander, referring to his father, said: "Philip found you poor wanderers, most of you clothed in sheepskins .... Philip gave you cloaks to wear instead of sheepskins, brought you down from the hills to the plains .... He made you dwellers of cities and civilized you with good laws and customs." (Arr. <i class="italic">Anab</i> . 7.9.2). We should not, however, be misled by this speech. Philip moved the Macedonians not to civilize them but rather to control them. His motive had to do with security, not culture. Civilizing would possibly have been a by-product of this process, but one should not confuse the by-product with the purpose. "Civilizing" or "Hellenizing" was not, per se, the purpose of any of the Hellenistic kings in founding colonies. On the other hand, a number of ancient authors make clear that civilizing or Hellenizing was a <i class="italic">result</i> of colonization. In talking about Alexander's achievement Plutarch pointed to the civilizing aspect: "By founding more than seventy cities among the barbarian tribes and by spreading Greek magistracies over Asia, Alexander overcame its wild and uncivilized way of life" (<i class="italic">De Alex. fort</i> . 1.328E). Appian, Ammianus Marcellinus, and Libanius emphasized the role of Seleukos as a builder of cities in the East:</p>
        <q class="blockquote">
          <p>He [Seleukos] founded cities throughout the length of the whole empire and named sixteen of them Antioch for his father, five Laodokeia for his mother, nine for himself, four after his wives, three Apameias and one Stratonikeia. The most famous of these even now are the two Seleukeias, the one by the sea and the other on the Tigris River, Laodikeia in Phoenicia, Antioch under Mount Lebanon, and Apameia in Syria. The other cities he gave names from Greece or Macedonia, for his own deeds or in honor of King Alexander. As a result the names of many Greek and Macedonian towns are to be found in Syria and the barbarous regions of upper Asia, such as Beroia, Edessa, Perinthos, Maroneia, Kallipolis, Achaia, Pella, Oropos, Amphipolis, Arethousa, Astakos, Tegea, Chalkis, Larissa, Heraia, and Apollonia; in Parthia Soteira, Kalliope, Chaffs, Hekatompylos, Achaia; in India</p>

          <p>The other kings have exalted themselves in destroying existing cities; he, on the other hand, arranged to build cities which did not yet exist. He established so many over the earth that they were enough to carry the names of towns in Macedonia as well as the names of those in his family; there were many cities that shared the name of a single person, whether man or woman. Moreover, if one should wish to compare him with the Athenians and Milesians, who are supposed to have sent out the greatest number of colonies, he would appear to be the greater colonizer, for he so much outstripped each of them in the magnitude of his works that one of his cities was worth ten of theirs. One can go to Phoenicia to see his cities, one can go to Syria and see even more and greater cities of his. He extended this noble work up to the Euphrates and the Tigris; and surrounding Babylon with cities, he scattered them everywhere, even in Persia. In short, there was no place suitable to receive a city that he left bare; rather, by Hellenizing the barbarian world he brought it to an end. (Lib. <i class="italic">Or</i> . 11.101-3)</p>
        </q>
        <p>What emerges from reading these passages is the tremendous effect that the settlement foundings had on the ancient world. What was said about Alexander and Seleukos and their colonization of the East could equally be said about the other kings in other parts of the Hellenistic world and especially in Asia Minor. In Asia Minor alone, over one hundred settlements were founded or refounded in the Hellenistic period. According to Pausanias (10.4.1) a town could not be considered a polis unless it at least had magistracies, a gymnasium, a theater, and an agora. Hellenistic colonization spread these institutions—and the settlements that bore them—throughout Asia Minor and the rest of the Middle East.</p>
        <p>To understand the impact of the settlement foundings it is useful to revert briefly to the fifth and fourth centuries <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> At that time all of Asia was under the tutelage of the Persian Empire. The Persian king was <i class="italic">the King</i> , as all students of Xenophon learn. The threat, potential or actual, of the Persian Empire was a motif that ran through Greek political thinking. In the fifth century Herodotus began his account of the Persian Wars by recounting the history of east-west conflict and tracing it to before the Trojan War! In the fourth century the humiliation of the King's Peace in 387 had allowed the King to reassert control over the Greek cities of Asia Minor. Alexander's</p>

        <p>conquest of the King removed, once and for all, the Persian (i.e., Eastern) threat. However, it did more than that. It opened a vast, new world and made possible the colonization of this world. So it was that Greeks and Macedonians were brought to the remotest parts of Asia Minor, Asia, and Egypt. They brought with them Greek culture and Greek civic life. But they brought this to the settlements, not the countryside, and probably never attempted to reach out to the native population beyond those living in the cities. In short the colonists remained an exclusive and exclusionary element in an essentially foreign environment. There <i class="italic">was</i> Hellenization among the native peoples. But it was probably limited mainly to the upper classes in the cities, and it was spontaneous. The experience of the Jews in Jerusalem leading up to the Hasmonean revolution is a good example of this.</p>
        <p>The HellenizedJews were very much the upper class of society. And it was they, not Antiochos IV Epiphanes, who initiated the pressure for Hellenization and reforms.<a name="fnd0e5845-ref" href="#fnd0e5845" data-tei-tag="ref">115</a> According to the author of I Maccabees, "in those days there went out from Israel lawless men, and they persuaded many, saying, 'Let us go and make a covenant with the nations around us, because ever since we separated from them much evil has overtaken us.' The plan was good in their eyes. Then some of the people were zealous and they went to the King and he gave them authority to keep the ordinances of the nations. And they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to the customs of the nations" (1.11-13). The parallel account in 2 Maccabees 4.9-15 also mentions, among other things, the building of the gymnasium. Furthermore it indicates that the leader of the Hellenizers was a new high priest, Jason, that the other priests, now disdainful of the temple service, hurried to the gymnasium, and that the "best of the young men" (</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00036.gif"></figure>
        ) followed along. The resistance to these changes came from outside Jerusalem. Its leader was Mattathias, whom the author of t Maccabees describes as a member of a priestly clan from Jerusalem who had settled in the foothills of Judaea in Modin (2.1). Furthermore, when his son, Judah, began organizing active opposition to Antiochos IV and the Hellenizing program he went to the villages (

        <p>Tarn and Griffith have suggested that the Hellenistic and especially the Seleucid scheme of colonization failed because the settlers "did not go out on</p>

        <p>the land" and that as a result the Asiatics never became Hellenized.<a name="fnd0e5890-ref" href="#fnd0e5890" data-tei-tag="ref">116</a> This charge assumes that Alexander and the Hellenistic dynasts, like the British raj in India, wanted to convert the native population. This assumption is unfounded. As best as one can see, the <i class="italic">purpose</i> of the various colonizing programs was military, economic, or political, not cultural. The primary motive of the king in founding colonies was to establish a Greco-Macedonian presence at a particular site and to maintain it. The Greco-Macedonian settlers did not go out on the land. They probably had no desire to go, nor did the kings particularly want this.<a name="fnd0e5898-ref" href="#fnd0e5898" data-tei-tag="ref">117</a> Except for the Antigonids, all the other dynasts were ruling foreign territories that had no Greco-Macedonian core or substratum. In order to anchor their rule they had to assert their presence by the creation of settlements whose names and populations constantly reminded one and all of the power of the ruling house. At the same time, the encouragement of a Hellenic </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00038.gif"></figure>
        , especially through the cultivation of the gymnasium as well as Greek civic life and ruler cult, reinforced the settlers in their identity and their loyalty to the royal house. The unhappiness of Alexander's colonists in the upper satrapies, who rebelled against Perdikkas because of a lack of Hellenic 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00039.gif"></figure>
        , was an object lesson not lost on any of the Successors (Diod. 18.7.1).
        <p></p>
        <p>For the Successors Hellenization meant fostering Hellenic culture primarily within the new settlements.<a name="fnd0e5905-ref" href="#fnd0e5905" data-tei-tag="ref">118</a> As a result, from the perspective of Plutarch, Appian, and Libanius the kings did Hellenize and civilize the East, because now a Greek could travel anywhere in Asia Minor or Asia and find Greek magistracies, gymnasia, theaters, and agoras. For the Greeks of the Hellenistic and Roman world the significance of the settlements was clear: they were the means whereby the barbarian world was, in Libanius' words, "Hellenized" and "brought to an end." But for Libanius Hellenization of the East did not mean the conversion of the East. Rather it meant the extension of Greek institutions to settlements in the region. And the same was undoubtedly true for Asia Minor. Whether the surrounding population was affected by the new polls culture was of little consequence. The barbarian world was brought to an end not by the conversion of barbarians but rather by the spread of the Greek <i class="italic">settlements</i> among the barbarians. When Appian and Plutarch looked at a map of Asia Minor and Asia they saw Alexandreias and Antiochs everywhere;</p>

        <p><i class="italic">this</i> was the Hellenization of the Maddie East. In short, if by "Hellenization" we mean the permanent conversion of the Middle East, then the Hellenistic colonies failed. If, on the other hand, by the term we mean—as did Plutarch and Libanius—the founding of Greek settlements throughout the East and the spread of Greek culture <i class="italic">to these settlements</i> , then the Hellenistic colonies succeeded admirably. In describing the Middle East that Xenophon and his cohorts encountered, A. H. M. Jones commented that "the <i class="italic">Anabasis</i> shows the Greek cities farther east were islets of civilization in a barbarian ocean."<a name="fnd0e5949-ref" href="#fnd0e5949" data-tei-tag="ref">119</a> A century later the same would be true of the Hellenistic colonies.</p>
        <p>The prominence in the Hellenistic period of cities that were Hellenistic foundations or refoundations is a good measure of the success of the various settlement programs. Two of the most important cities of the Hellenistic and Roman world, Antioch on the Orontes and Alexandreia, were new foundations. The latter city shared with Pergamon the distinction of being among the great centers of culture in the Hellenistic world. The Peace of Apameia, which permanently removed the Seleucids from Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains, was signed at the Seleucid settlement. Numerous Hellenistic foundations and refoundations appear on the Delphic <i class="italic"> theorodokoi</i> list of c. 230-220 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> and later in 81 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> among the cities that recognized the inviolability of the temple of Hekate at STRATONIKEIA in Caria (itself a Hellenistic colony).<a name="fnd0e5957-ref" href="#fnd0e5957" data-tei-tag="ref">120</a> We also see Hellenistic foundations exchanging <i class="italic">isopoliteia</i> , and their citizens acting as judges in international disputes.<a name="fnd0e5975-ref" href="#fnd0e5975" data-tei-tag="ref">121</a> A number of foundations were the sites of royal mints, while still more</p>

        <p>minted civic coinage.<a name="fnd0e6013-ref" href="#fnd0e6013" data-tei-tag="ref">122</a> In short, the settlements took a full and active role in the Hellenistic world, and many continued to flourish under Roman rule.</p>
        <p>Livy (37.54.18) in the first century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> , Tacitus (<i class="italic">Ann</i> . 6.42) in the early second century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> , and Cassius Dio (40.16) in the early third century <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span> all attest to the continued vitality and Greco-Macedonian character of the settlements. Furthermore, Christianity was nurtured in many of these settlements. In his travels Paul of Tarsos (which was itself refounded as an Antioch) visited many such cities, including Antioch on the Orontes, ANTIOCH near Pisidia, Ephesos (ARSINOE), and THESSALONIKE. The seven "Churches of Asia" (Rev. 1.11) were located in cities of Asia Minor that had been founded or refounded in the Hellenistic period: PERGAMON, Smyrna (EURYDIKEIA), Ephesos (ARSINOE), LAODIKEIA, PHILADELPHEIA, SARDIS, and THYATEIRA. The first great council of the Church was, of course, held at NIKAIA and was convened by an emperor who, in refounding Byzantion as Constantinople, was following good, Hellenistic tradition.</p>
        <p>To the criticism that the Hellenistic colonization of the Middle East ultimately failed one may answer that time and contemporary witnesses give proof of its success. It is true that by the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> Ammianus Marcellinus could remark that the old native town names were being used, supplanting the Greek toponyms imposed when the settlements were founded by Seleukos (14.8.6). But this was five to six hundred years after the colonies had been founded! The extraordinary thing is that so many of the settlements remained identifiably Greek for so long. One is reminded of the (apocryphal?) anecdote told about Charles de Gaulle's visit to Stalingrad. After viewing the war-torn city he remarked, "<i class="italic">Formidable, formidable.</i> " When his Russian hosts asked, "What, <i class="italic">mon général?</i> " de Gaulle replied, "Ah, that the Germans should have come so far."</p>

        <p>Livy (31.27.2) describes Antipatreia in southern Illyria as a strongly fortified city in a narrow pass that the Romans sacked and burned in 200 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> In the nineteenth century Leake suggested that Berat occupied the site of Antipatreia. Hammond, noting that Berat "is built on a steep hill on both sides of the narrow gorge of the river Osum," concurred with the general acceptance of the identification of the site. Hammond found a few pieces of Macedonian foundation courses there and reported the discovery of traces of fire in the remains. The founder of the town may have been Kassandros, who will have named it in memory of his father, Antipater. The founding date is also unknown. If Kassandros was the founder, we can likewise suggest that he founded it after he came into possession of Illyria, around 314 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span></p>

The "Chersonese of Epirus" is the peninsula of Preveza; Berenike was probably located at the site of the harbor village of Kastrosikia, which is, according to Hammond, a four-hour walk north of the town of Preveza.<sup class="superscript">3</sup></p>
        <p><b class="bold">In general</b> see Tscherikower, 5; P. Lévêque, <i class="italic">Pyrrhos</i> , 122; Hammond, <i class="italic">Epirus</i> , 578-79; S.

        <p>1. Plutarch actually gives "Berenikis" as the name of the town (<i class="italic">Pyrrh</i> . 6.1); this form is not found elsewhere (see A. B. Nederlof, <i class="italic">Plutarchus' Leven van Pyrrhus</i> [Amsterdam, 1940] 29). Stephanos (s.v. "Berenike 1") says the town was founded by "Pyrrhos the Younger." Hammond suggests that the town was named both to honor Pyrrhos' mother-in-law and to commemorate the landing of Egyptian forces at his restoration in 297 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">Epirus</i> , 579).</p>
        <p>2. Appian (<i class="italic">Mith</i> . 1.4) records a meeting at Berenike of the Bithynian prince Nikomedes, the Bithynian envoy Menas, and the Attalid envoy Andronikos, the purpose of which was to secure the throne for Nikomedes: </p>

        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00042.gif"></figure>
        . The question is, which Berenike is meant? The most likely interpretation is that the three, who were on their way back to Asia from Rome, met at Berenike in Epirus after crossing over from Italy (thus Hansen, <i class="italic"> Attalids</i>
        <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 137; Lévêque, 122; and Horace White in the Loeb edition). However, Hammond objects because "in the sequel of the story they go to Attalus and this context shows the 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00043.gif"></figure>
         here is the mainland of Asia Minor" (<i class="italic">Epirus</i> , 579 n. 1). However, Appian provides no indication as to how much time elapsed between the acclamation of Nikomedes and his meeting with Attalos. Furthermore, I know of no Berenike on the Asia Minor coast where they could have met. (BERENIKE in Cilicia was too far east. BERENIKE on Chios was apparently founded by Mithridates Eupator long after the events described by Appian.) Hammond also suggests (p. 657) that a Berenike recorded in the Delphic <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list (dated to c. 230-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ; see ANTIGONEIA Mantineia) is "probably in Cyrenaica but ... may be the place in ... Epirus." It is certainly the Cyrenaican city. In the <i class="italic"> theorodokoi</i> list the four cities of Cyrenaica are listed in an east-to-west progression: Cyrene, Ptolemais, Arsinoe, Berenike (A. Plassart, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 45 [1921] 21, col. IV.19, and p. 62).
        <p></p>
        <p>3. For the probable <b class="bold">location</b> of Berenike at Kastrosikia see Hammond, <i class="italic">Epirus</i> , 49, 578-79, and map on p. 47. Cf.

Oberhummer (<i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Berenike 2," followed by Hansen, <i class="italic">Attalids</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 137 n. 1) and Garoufalias (244) believe that Berenike was the site of the later Nikopolis. Tscherikower's suggestion (5) of Aktion is most</p>

        <p>unlikely. According to Kienast (<i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Pyrrhos," 119) Pyrrhos planned to make Berenike his capital; he changed his mind after the annexation of Ambrakia and made the latter his capital instead.</p>

        <p>In describing the Roman siege in 189 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> of Ambrakia, the capital of Pyrrhos' kingdom, both Polybius (21.27.2) and Livy (38.5.2 and 6.1) refer to attacks launched against the "Pyrrheion." Unfortunately the references do not make clear what the "Pyrrheion" was or where it was located. It has been suggested that this was either a fortified palace that Pyrrhos built as an extension to Ambrakia or a whole new fortified settlement—which possibly included a palace added on to the city.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> On the other hand, throughout the Hellenistic world there were numerous sacred precincts named after the person honored or buried there. It is more likely, therefore, that the Pyrrheion was a <i class="italic">temenos</i> that probably contained the tomb of Pyrrhos.<sup class="superscript">2</sup></p>

        <p>1. Garoufalias suggested (33 and 247) that the Pyrrheion was a palace that gave its name to the new settlement; Hammond believed (<i class="italic">Epirus</i> , 145 and 584) it was a "fortified suburb" (followed by Walbank, <i class="italic">Comment</i> ., 3: 124). The precise location of the palace/suburb (if in fact the Pyrrheion was either of these) is not definitely known; see further Hammond, 145-48 (map, p. 141); Garoufalias, 247-48.</p>
        <p>2. For the suggestion that the Pyrrheion was the monument that held Pyrrhos' ashes see, for example, Beloch (<i class="italic">GG</i>

          <sup class="superscript"> 2</sup> , 3), followed Borrell, who suggested the five coins he published were from the Agathopolis mentioned by George Pachymeres and that the city was located in or near the Thracian Chersonese. The problem is that no city of this name was known in that area (see, for example, U. Kahrstedt, <i class="italic">Beiträge zur Geschichte der thrakischen Chersones</i> [Baden-Baden, 1954] 39 n. 111). Borrell also suggested that the city was named for Agathokles.</p>
        <p>There was, however, an Agathopolis on the Black Sea coast of what is now southern Bulgaria. While referring to Pachymeres (<i class="italic">De Mich.

Furthermore, the <i class="italic">Notitiae</i> place it in the archdiocese of Adrianople, between Sozopolis and Develtos (west of Sozopolis). In 1948 a native of Agathopolis, E. G.

In a brief section on the city in antiquity, Bapheus placed the coins with A<span class="Symbol">G</span> A<span class="Symbol">Q</span> O, etc., at the Byzantine-modern Agathopolis.

Bapheus identified the coinage with Agathopolis/Ahtopol but provided no argumentation for so doing (61-67; cf. Robert, <i class="italic">RPh</i> [1959] 234-35). L.

        <p>The first settlement was built, according to Appian (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 1), as a bulwark against the Thracian menace. Of course it also protected Lysimachos from Antigonos Monophthalmos. It included at least two nearby towns—Paktye and Kardia. Pausanias adds that in the course of the founding Kardia was destroyed (1.9.8). Presumably, as happened in similar instances elsewhere, the Kardians were moved to the site of the new settlement.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> Justin mentions (17.1-2) that twenty-two years after its founding Lysimacheia was the victim of a major earthquake. In 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Seleukos Nikator, having crossed the Hellespont on his way to take possession of Lysimacheia, was murdered by Ptolemy Keraunos (App. <i class="italic">Syr</i> . 62). The latter then proceeded to Lysimacheia, where he appeared wearing a diadem (Memnon, <i class="italic">FGrH</i> 434 F8.3). According to Appian (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 64), after Lysimachos died the inhabitants of the city buried him in a temple that they then called "the Lysimacheion." This suggests the establishment of a founder cult.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> Under Lysimachos the city produced autonomous bronzes and had a royal mint. Posthumous issues of Lysimachos continued to appear for a generation after the king's death in 281 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> The posthumous issues were followed by Seleucid tetradrachms apparently coined in each of the three short periods after the death of Seleukos I when the Seleucids were in Thrace: under Antiochos II (c. 250 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), Hierax (c. 227-226 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), and finally in the refounded city under Antiochos III (c. 196-190 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ). Lysimacheia was recorded on the Delphic <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list, which is now dated to c. 230-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , and was briefly occupied by Philip V at the end of the third century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span>
          <sup class="superscript">3</sup> After he withdrew in 199/8 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , it fell to the Thracians, who destroyed it (Polyb. 18.4.5).</p>
        <p>The refounding of Lysimacheia is described in some detail both by Livy (33.38.10-11 and 40.6) and Appian (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 1). From these authors we learn that Antiochos discovered the city abandoned and in ruins as a result of the recent sacking by Thracians. Appreciating its strategic location, the king decided to reestablish the city, both to gain control of Thrace as well as to provide a secure base for operations against the Romans. He repopulated it by calling back inhabitants who had fled and ransoming those who had been sold into slavery. He also invited new settlers and tried to entice them by various inducements. The king rebuilt walls and homes and provided sheep, cattle, and agricultural implements. In order to complete the project as expeditiously as possible Antiochos ordered half his army and all his naval allies to take part in the rebuilding. The other part of the army he took with him on an expedition to devastate the neighboring areas of Thrace. Finally, he declared that the rebuilt city would be a residence for his son, Seleukos (the future Seleukos IV Philopator; Polyb. 18.51.8; Livy 35.15.5).<sup class="superscript">4</sup> In fact, when the false news of the death of the boy-king Ptolemy V caused Antiochos to break off the conference with the Romans at Lysimacheia in 196 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , he left Seleukos in charge of rebuilding the city (Livy 33.41.4-5).</p>

        <p>An inscription found at Ilion records a treaty between King Antiochos and Lysimacheia. We are probably concerned with Antiochos III. The king promises to uphold the city's [autonomy] and democracy, to keep it tribute-free and ungarrisoned, and to defend it if attacked. In his oath the king makes specific reference to the <i class="italic">phrouria</i> and the harbor of the city.

For the inclusion of Paktye in the new foundation see Pliny <i class="italic">NH</i> 4.48. Stephanos' comment (s.v.

Despite Pausanias' assertion that Kardia was destroyed when Lysimacheia was founded, it did not disappear (see, for example, Appian, Ptolemy, and Strabo): either the town was not totally destroyed or, if it was, it was subsequently rebuilt on a lesser scale. Note that in his description of the founding of ARSINOE Ephesos Pausanias says (1.4.7) that Lysimachos destroyed Kolophon and Lebedos in order to populate the new city. In fact we know that both cities were in existence afterward. On the question of the "destruction" of a city and the various forms it could take see KOLOPHON.</p>

        <p>On <b class="bold">Seleucid coinage minted at or for Lysimacheia</b> see Newell, <i class="italic">WSM</i> , 353-58, nos. 1610-21. The assignment of these coins to Lysimacheia is rendered reasonably secure by the presence of the city's badge, a lion's head. On the other hand, the attribution of the coins to particular Seleucid monarchs is less secure. Newell attributed nos. 1610-13 to Antiochos II, 1614 (which may have been minted at Lampsakos) to Hierax, and 1615-21 to Antiochos III. Boehringer (<i class="italic">Zur Chronologie</i> , 65, 161, no. 29) grouped nos. 1625-20 with Hierax and 1621 with Antiochos III. Houghton (<i class="italic">CSE</i> , 61) attributed only coinage of Antiochos II and Hierax to Lysimacheia, though he later expressed agreement with the assignment of no. 1621 to Antiochos III (see Le Rider, <i class="italic"> QT</i> 17 [1988] 200). Most recently Le Rider (<i class="italic">QT</i> [1988] 195-207) modified Newell's attributions by reassigning nos. 1615-20 from Antiochos III to Antiochos II. Le Rider noted (200-201) the discovery of two hoards, one dated to c. 245-235 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Gülnar: A. Davesne, <i class="italic">CRAI</i> [1981] 356-70; see now Davesne and Le Rider, <i class="italic">Meydancikkale</i> 227-30) and the other dated to c. 246 or a little later (Tel Halaf: <i class="italic">IGCH</i> 1763), and pointed out that "deux exemplaires du <i class="italic"> WSM</i> 1615-1620 figurent dans le trésor (<i class="italic">i.e</i> . of Meydancikkale)." This excluded the attribution of these coins to Antiochos III. The assignment of nos. 1610-13 as well as 1615-20 to Antiochos II indicates a significant minting and reflects Antiochos' active presence in the region; see also ANTIOCH in the Propontis; J. Youroukova, in <i class="italic">Studia Naster</i> , 120ff.</p>
        <p>Gardner's suggestion (<i class="italic">NC</i> [1878] 92-93, followed by Babelon, <i class="italic">RdS</i> , XXXVII, XLIX) that Antiochos I may have minted coins in Europe is very uncertain (see Beloch, <i class="italic">GG</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 4.2: 356); neither Newell (<i class="italic">WSM</i> , 354) nor Houghton (<i class="italic">CSE</i> , 61) assign any coins to him.

          and E Frisch, <i class="italic"> ZPE</i> 17 (1975) 101-6 (= <i class="italic">I. Ilion</i> 45). Frisch identified the king as Antiochos III (see also E Piejko, <i class="italic">Hist</i> . 37 [1988] 151-56). J. L. Ferrary and P. Gauthier (<i class="italic">JS</i> [1981] 327-45) in a very thorough discussion questioned this identification on both historical and palaeographic grounds. They suggest an earlier date ("270-260?") and hypothesize the king may have been Antiochos I, "peut-être Antiochos II" (p. 343). I do not believe their arguments are convincing.</p>

        <p>In the first place they point out that while King Antiochos swore to preserve the [autonomy] and freedom of the city and to keep it free of a garrison and of tribute (ll. 13-15), the literary evidence indicates that in 196 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Antiochos III's son remained at Lysimacheia with an army (Livy 33.41.4) and that in 190, under pressure, Antiochos ordered the garrison (<i class="italic">praesidium</i> ) withdrawn from Lysimacheia (Livy 37.31.1). However, it is well known that in the Hellenistic world the gap between theory and practice when it came to matters such as the granting or guaranteeing of freedom and autonomy was immense. It would be naive to think that just because the king granted these conditions he actually lived by them—or intended to. In the second place Ferrary and Gauthier claim that the two fragments that make up this inscription do not belong to the same stele (350ff.). Their arguments are based on a consideration of the letterforms—a highly subjective criterion at best, especially as Tasliklioglu<a name="d0e4679-ref" href="#d0e4679" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          and Frisch have claimed on the basis of the letterforms and length of lines that the two fragments belong to the same stele (103). Given the known fact of Antiochos' presence at Lysimacheia and his (and his son's) involvement with the city, it appears most likely—in the present state of the evidence—that he is the "King Antiochos" in the treaty with Lysimacheia.</p>
        <p>For the earlier treaty between Philip V and Lysimacheia (<i class="italic">Staats</i> . III.549, c. 202-199/8 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ) see D. Pandermalis, <i class="italic">Studies Edson</i> , 285-86.</p>

Hereward, <i class="italic">ABSA</i> 57 (1962) 178-79. Hereward reasonably suggests that the <i class="italic">strategoi</i> were the "governing board" of the city and that "they were twelve because one took the chair every month" (178).</p>
        <p>7. <b class="bold">Location</b> . The various literary sources indicate that Lysimacheia was in the middle of the Chersonesos, surrounded by Paktye on the Propontis and Kardia on the Melas Gulf (e.g., Pliny <i class="italic">NH</i> 4.48; Strabo 7, frags. 51, 53), and that Pausanias (second century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> ) saw the grave of Lysimachos, which Appian (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 64) says was in Lysimacheia, at a spot between Paktye and Kardia (1.10.4). Nevertheless the precise site of Lysimacheia has not yet been identified with certainty. Some MSS of Ptolemy (3.11.7) place it at Hexamilion (the modern Ortaköy; see Müller's note: </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00047.gif"></figure>
         "inepte adsunt"); this is followed, for example, in Smith's <i class="italic">Dict. Geog.</i> s.v. "Lysimachia." Casson (<i class="italic">Macedonia, Thrace and Illyria</i> [Oxford, 1928] map opposite p. 211; also p. 225) places it on the Melas Gulf near Kardia. But Walbank (<i class="italic">Comment</i> ., 2: 478) cited Appian (<i class="italic">BCiv</i> . 4.88), who says Kardia and Lysimacheia protected the entrance to the Chersonesos "like gates"; this suggests, as Walbank remarks, "that one stood on or near either side" (sc. of the isthmus). One hypothesis would place Lysimacheia near the Hellespont and in the vicinity of Bolayir. This location was first suggested by L. Robert (<i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 5 [1948] 51-54 and 10 [1955] 266-71); subsequently D. Hereward identified the nearby Sukrüler Tepe as the actual site of the town (<i class="italic">Archaeology</i> 11 [1958] 129 and map). On the other hand, in a recent, extensive study of the problem Kai Brodersen reverted to the citation in Ptolemy and suggested Hexamilion (Ortaköy)

        <p>According to Livy (44.10.8), Antigoneia was a town near the south coast of Chalcidice, located between Aineia and the peninsula of Pallene. It is recorded in the Delphic <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list (A. Plassart, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 45 [1921] 18, col. III.76) between Aineia and Kassandreia and is also mentioned by ps.

        <p>1. There are <b class="bold">two other epigraphic attestations for an Antigoneia</b> — undoubtedly the Chalcidian rather than the Paeonian one: L. Robert, <i class="italic">RPh</i> (1939) 144 and <i class="italic">OGIS</i> 441.182-83 (= <i class="italic">I. Strat</i> . 508.40-41: an "Antigoneia in Macedonia" included in a list of cities recognizing the inviolability of the temple of Hekate at Stratonikeia in Caria from 81 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ). Similarly, Stephanos records an Antigoneia of Macedonia (s.v. no. 3) that he says was a foundation of Antigonos Gonatas. It is not clear whether this refers to the Chalcidian or the Paeonian one. However, if, as appears likely, Papazoglou is correct in her claim (<i class="italic">The Central Balkan Tribes in Pre-Roman Times</i> [Amsterdam, 1978] 145-46) that Paeonia first came under Antigonid rule when Doson conquered it, then Stephanos' reference can only be to the Chalcidian city.</p>
        <p>Under Macedonia Ptolemy mentions Antigoneia Psaphara (3.12.35) and Antigoneia of Mygdonia (3.12.33). At 3.12.35 Ptolemy writes </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00048.gif"></figure>

        . It has generally been assumed that this Antigoneia was the Chalcidian one and that Psaphara was either its earlier name (so, for example, Tscherikower, 3) or an adjective, "sandy" (L. Robert, <i class="italic">RPh</i> [1939] 145-46). Papazoglou, on the other hand, noted that at 3.12.35 Antigoneia Psaphara is grouped with Moryllos and Klitai and is listed under Paraktia. She remarked that whereas earlier it was assumed Moryllos and Klitai were Chalcidian towns, it is now clear that Moryllos was in the interior of Mygdonia in the region of Kilkis (<i class="italic">Villes</i> , 323-24, 183).

        <p>According to Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 4.34) there was an Antigoneia between Stobi and Europos on the Axios River. The <i class="italic">Tabula Peutingeriana</i> (VI.5) places it on the road from Stobi to Thessalonike as does the Ravenna Geographer (IV.9.7, p. 51, ed. Schnetz: Asigonia, i.e., Antigonia).<sup class="superscript">1</sup> The founder is not definitely known. Part of Paeonia probably first came under Antigonid rule during the reign of Antigonos Doson.

        <p>Under Macedonia Ptolemy mentions Antigoneia of Mygdonia (3.12.33) and Antigoneia Psaphara (3.12.35). Some scholars have suggested that by the former Ptolemy meant Antigoneia in Paeonia (so, for example, Tscherikower, 2). However, Mygdonia did not extend that far north. This prompted L. Robert to reject Ptolemy's reference to Antigoneia being in Mygdonia (<i class="italic">RPh</i> [1939] 144-45). Papazoglou, noting that in his enumeration Ptolemy lists Kalindoia immediately after Antigoneia of Mygdonia, suggested that under this heading Ptolemy in fact meant ANTIGONEIA in Chalcidice (<i class="italic">Villes</i> , 324). For other references to an Antigoneia in Macedonia that may refer either to this or to the Chalcidian city see ANTIGONEIA in Chalcidice.</p>

Hammond (op. cit., 174) suggested Antigoneia may have been near Banja. Since the Peutinger Table gives XII miles as the distance from Stobi to Antigoneia, while the distance of the former to Banja is approximately 25 km, Hammond suggested emending the text from XII to XVII (172; on errors in the Peutinger Table see Pritchett, <i class="italic">Topography</i> , 3: 202 and n. 20); cf. G. I. Kazarow (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 47 [1923] 299-300), who thought Antigoneia was at Negotino. Miller (<i class="italic">Itineraria Romana</i> , 573) suggested Vojšanci; Papazoglou (<i class="italic">Villes</i> , 326) opted for Budur Ciflik. On the location see also L. Heuzey and H.

        <p>Among the people living in Macedonia, Pliny mentions the Antiochienses (<i class="italic">NH</i> 4.35). We do not know who these were, where precisely they were located and, if they were descended from a Hellenistic settlement, who founded the colony.</p>
        <p>Jones (<i class="italic">Greek City</i> , 306 n. 12) suggests either that the Antiochienses were named for Antiochos I Soter, the second husband of Stratonike and the brother-in-law of Antigonos Gonatas, or that the term is a mistake for Antigonenses. The first suggestion is unlikely. When Hellenistic monarchs gave personal names to settlements they usually named them for more immediate relatives; see, for example, Appian (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 57), who says that Seleukos named cities for his father, mother, his wives, and himself; but cf. BERENIKE in Epirus, which Pyrrhos named for his mother-in-law. It is of course possible that Pliny made an error and that he meant Antigonenses (so Jones, op. cit., and Papazoglou, <i class="italic">Villes</i> , 420). Note, however, that at section 34 he did mention ANTIGONEIA in Paeonia. In that case he used the toponym rather than the ethnic.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, Vokotopoulou (97) believed the inscription meant the recipients of Alexander's largesse were individual Macedonians.

Vokotopoulou demonstrated (97-98) that the first nineteen lines— which included the record of the first ten priests—were inscribed by the same hand and that subsequent additions were made by different hands. Furthermore Vokotopoulou dated the whole inscription palaeographically to the period 330-300 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> This pointed to the period 330-320 as the time when the first ten names were inscribed by the same stonecutter, and the decade 340-330 for the beginning of the new era dated by the eponymous priests. Furthermore she suggested that Alexander made the gift during the winter of 335/4, i.e., between his return from Greece and his departure for Asia.

        <p>According to Stephanos (s.v. "Phila"), Phila was founded in Macedonia by Demetrios II on the Peneios River and named for his mother. Phila was five miles from Herakleion (Livy 44.8.9) and occupied a strategic site at the entrance to the Vale of Tempe.

Leake (<i class="italic">NG</i> , 3: 422) placed it near the mouth of the Peneios on the north bank; Hammond objects to this because it would locate Phila too far south to conform with Livy's information that it was five miles from Herakleion. L. Heuzey (<i class="italic">Le Mont Olympe et l'Acarnanie</i> [Paris, 1860] 80f.) suggested it was located at the village of Piryetos, where he found some capitals and inscriptions. The strategic importance of Phila can be seen in the frequency with which it is mentioned in the course of Livy's narrrative of the war against Perseus: e.g., 44.2.12, 3.7, 8.1, 8.8, 34.10. According to Livy, Perseus left (<i class="italic">relinquit</i> ) a small garrison force there (42.67.2). Furthermore it was an important supply depot (44.7.12); see further, Hammond and Walbank, <i class="italic">Macedonia</i> , 3: 528-30.</p>

All of the above agree, as is most likely, that "Queen Stratonike" was Gonatas' sister. Cf., however, W.

        <p>1. The <b class="bold">founding</b> date of 316/5 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> for Kassandreia is fixed by Diod. 19.52.2 and the Marmor Parium (<i class="italic">FGrH</i> 239 F B14). Furthermore Kassandros refounded THEBES in 316/5 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> This lends support to the notion that Kassandros likewise founded THESSALONIKE around the same time. For Thessalonike see Carney, 137 and n. 16; id., in <i class="italic">Women's History and Ancient History</i> , ed. S. B. Pomeroy (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1991) 169 n. 42; W. L.

        <p>2. At 7, frag. 21 Strabo says that Kassandros destroyed (</p>

        ) the inhabitants to the new foundation. Strabo mentions the names of six of the communities involved in the synoecism: Apollonia, Chalastra, Therme, Gareskos, Aineia, and Kissos (on these towns see Papazoglou, 198-201; Dion. Hal. also says that Kassandros destroyed Aineia and removed its inhabitants to Thessalonike, 1.49.4). At frag. 24 Strabo says

        <div id="JD_Page_103" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">103</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_103"></div>
        <p>that Thessalonike was the renamed Therme and adds that Kassandros transferred (</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00075.gif"></figure>
        ) the inhabitants to it. Despite the assertions about destruction and transfer, we know from other evidence that some of these towns continued to exist: for example, Apollonia (Livy 45.28.8; Acts 17.1), Aineia (Livy 44.10.7), Gareskos (Strabo 7, frag. 36; Ptol. 3.12.22). Chalastra is also mentioned elsewhere by Strabo (7, frags. 20 and 23), but here he may be reproducing a pre-Hellenistic source (see Edson, <i class="italic">CPh</i> 42 [1947] 102 n. 101). Furthermore it is important to remember that the "destruction" of a city or town could take a number of forms, from the physical destruction of (parts of) the city or city wall to—more frequently—the deprivation of its rights as an autonomous body. On the "destruction" of cities see KOLOPHON. On the synoecism see also Papazoglou, <i class="italic">Villes</i> , 189-90.
        <p></p>
        <p>Two other names are attested for Thessalonike: Halia and Emathia. Stephanos (s.v. "Thessalonike") and the <i class="italic">Etymologicum Magnum</i> (s.v. "Thessalonike"), who give the <b class="bold">founder</b> as Kassandros, say that the city had once been called Halia. This is our sole source of information about Halia. It is not clear whether the term was a name for a town or a region. A number of scholars have suggested the term was related to </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00076.gif"></figure>
         ("pertaining to the sea") and, for example, reflected the name given by inhabitants of the interior to the coastal city of Thessalonike (Tafrali, op. cit., 5) or the name of the coastal region before the founding of Thessalonike (Oberhummer, op. cit., 145); see further Papazoglou, <i class="italic">Villes</i> , 195-96.
        <p></p>
        <p>Zonaras (<i class="italic">Hist</i> . 12.26) comments that it had been known as Emathia. Papazoglou has plausibly suggested (196-98) that it may have been one of the towns included in the synoecism. Stephanos and the <i class="italic">Etym. Magnum</i> , as well as Constant. Porphyr. (<i class="italic">De thema</i> . 23 [<i class="italic">Pat. Gr.</i> , 113: 120-21]), record a doubtful tradition that associated the name of the city with Philip II and a victory he gained over the Thessalians. Also doubtful is the assertion of the Heidelberg Epitome (<i class="italic">FGrH</i> 155 F2.4) that Thessalonike herself founded the city.</p>
        <p>3. M. Vickers's observation that "the site of Therme and its relationship to Thessaloniki is one of the oldest problems of Macedonian topography" is quite correct. For full discussion of the problem and further references, see Vickers (<i class="italic">Studies Edson</i> , 327-33) and G. Bakalakis (<i class="italic">AK</i> Beiheft 1 [1958] 30-34), who favored the identification of Thessalonike and Therme; Hammond (<i class="italic">Macedonia</i> , 1: 150-51) and Papazoglou (<i class="italic">Villes</i> , 190-95), who rejected the identification; and C. Edson (<i class="italic">CPh</i> 42 [1947] 100-104), who suggested Therme was "at, or very near, Salonica." See also K. A. Romaios, <i class="italic">Makedonika</i> 1 (1940) 1-7 and map on p. 6.</p>
        <p>For the identification of <b class="bold">Therme and Thessalonike</b> see also the following— late—sources: schol. to Thuc. 1.61.2 (ed. Haase [Paris, 1855]); Malalas 7.243 (<i class="italic">CSHB</i> XXVIII, p. 190); Tzetzes <i class="italic">Chil</i> . 10.174-75 (ed. P. Leone, 1963); <i class="italic"> Nomina urbium mutata</i> (in A. Burckhardt's edition of Hierokles [Leipzig, 1893]), App. 1.55, 1a-15, 3.106. <i class="italic">Nota bene</i> that the reliability of many of these later sources is questionable (see, for example, Oberhummer, op. cit., 145, and Edson, <i class="italic">CPh</i> 42 [1947] 102 n. 104). Cf. Procopius (<i class="italic">Aed</i> . 4.4 [B.279]), who mentions a Therme among the places in</p>

        <p>Macedonia fortified by Justinian. Obviously if it is the Therme of the archaic and classical periods, then it and Thessalonike will have been distinct. However, the precise identification of Procopius' Therme is not certain. Vickers, for example, suggests it was another city located some distance from Thessalonike (<i class="italic">CR</i> 88 [1974] 10-11; <i class="italic">Studies Edson</i> , 330). Note that Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 4.36) also says that Thessalonike and Therme were different cities. Hammond (op. cit.), on the basis of the fact that Pliny distinguishes between the two places, likewise separates them and postulates that the cape of Mikro Karaburnu was the site of Therme. For the (less likely) view that Therme was located at Sedhes (where there are warm springs), 10 km to the southeast, see Oberhummer, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.vv. "Therme," 2392, and "Thessalonike," 145; and the authors of the <i class="italic">ATL</i> , 1: 546 (contra, Edson, 100-101). Romaios's view (op. cit.) that Therme was a collective name for a group of villages extending from the modern Thessalonike to Sedhes is not likely.</p>

        <p>Strabo (7, frag. 35) tells us that Alexarchos, the eccentric brother of King Kassandros, founded a city on Mount Athos and called it Uranopolis. Strabo adds that it had a circuit of thirty stades. Alexarchos, who called himself the Sun, invented a new language for his city; Athenaeus records an indecipherable letter in this dialect that he sent to Kassandreia (3.98d-f). The date of the founding is not known but was probably around 316 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , which is the period when Kassandros founded Thessalonike and Kassandreia and restored Thebes.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> We do not know how long the new toponym lasted.</p>
        <p>The coins of Uranopolis are interesting. They bear the legend </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>The location of Uranopolis has not yet been fixed. Some indication is given by Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 4.37), who enumerates the towns of the peninsula from northwest to southeast and begins with Uranopolis. His omission of Sane suggests that it may have been the site of Uranopolis. On the other hand, Uranopolis coins known to Leake were found in the vicinity of Akanthos (which <i class="italic">is</i> mentioned by Pliny). Presumably Uranopolis was located at or near one of these towns.<sup class="superscript">4</sup></p>

Athenaeus (3.98f-99a), who remarks that even Pythian Apollo could not have succeeded at that!</p>
        <p>2. For the <b class="bold">coinage</b> of Uranopolis see, for example, Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">M.

Because of, among other things, their low weight, the authenticity of the autonomous tetradrachms was questioned by P. Lederer (<i class="italic">ZfN</i> 41 [1931] 47-54). However, N. Breitenstein (<i class="italic">Acta Archaeologica</i> 13 [1942] 248-50) argued for their authenticity. He pointed out that the low weight of the tetradrachms was in fact similar to the weight of late posthumous Philips (see also M. Thompson, <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 26 [1981] 43).</p>
        <p>3. The <b class="bold">attribution of some posthumous Alexander coinage, previously grouped by Müller with Amphipolis, Akrothooi, or designated as uncertain, to Uranopolis</b> (<i class="italic">Numismatique d'Alexandre le Grand</i> [Copenhagen, 1855] nos. 62, 66-75, 641-45, and possibly 151-78 as well; see now Price, <i class="italic">Alexander and Philip</i> , 139f., nos. 509-23) was first made by Imhoof-Blumer (<i class="italic">M. Gr</i> ., 97). Imhoof-Blumer based this attribution on the appearance of the A-torch as well as the pyramid surmounted by a star or the fulmen-I on certain Alexanders and on the coinage of Uranopolis. He was followed by, among others, Breitenstein (above, note 2); R. W. Mathisen, <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 26 (1981) 115; the <i class="italic">SNG Ashmolean Museum</i> 2657-58; and <i class="italic">SNG</i> (Cop) <i class="italic">Macedonia</i> 697-708. The attribution, however, is not secure (so, for example, Price, <i class="italic">Alexander and Philip</i> , 139 n. 3). A. R. Bellinger (<i class="italic">Essays on the Coinage of Alexander the Great</i> [New York, 1963] 90), Thompson (<i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 26 [1981] 40-44), and Newell (see Thompson, <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> [1981] 40 n. 16) assigned this coinage to Amphipolis.</p>
        <p>4. On the <b class="bold">location</b> of Uranopolis see the discussion by Imhoof-Blumer, 97-98. For the discovery of bronze coins at and near Erisso (the site of Akanthos) see Leake, <i class="italic">Num. Hell</i> ., "European Greece," p. 109; id., <i class="italic">NG</i> , 3: 148-49. Imhoof-Blumer also notes (98 n. 68) that Akanthos stopped minting shortly before the founding of Uranopolis and Sane apparently never minted. For the less likely identification of Uranopolis with Akrothooi at the tip of Athos see Head, <i class="italic">BMC Macedonia</i> , xxxii.</p>
        <p>Tarn suggests (430) that the Macedonian Uranopolis colonized the like-named town in Pamphylia mentioned by Ptolemy (5.5.5). There is no extant evidence to support this contention. See also Wrist, <i class="italic"> RE</i> s.v. "Uranopolis 2."</p>

        <p>According to Strabo (10.2.22), the village of Konope was refounded as the polls of Arsinoe by the like-named queen "who was the wife and sister of Ptolemy II."<sup class="superscript">1</sup> There is evidence for the worship of Herakles.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> Some gravestones (c. 250-150 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ) have survived.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> While Strabo and the other literary sources normally refer to the town as "Arsinoe," an inscription records the form "Arsinoeia."

        <p><b class="bold">In general</b> see W.J. Woodhouse, <i class="italic">Aetolia</i> (Oxford, 1897) 209-21; Tscherikower, 5; Bölte, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Lysimacheia 1"; Longega, <i class="italic">Arsinoe II</i> , 33-35.</p>
        <p>1. Strabo actually refers to Konope as Konopa (10.2.22). There are three schools of thought regarding the circumstances of the <b class="bold"> founding</b> . (1) Some scholars follow Strabo literally and claim that Arsinoe (or Ptolemy II Philadelphos) founded the city while she was the wife of Philadelphos, i.e., between 277 and 268 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (on the date of Arsinoe's death see ARSINOE Methana, note 4); see, for example, Droysen, <i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 2: 755; P. M. Fraser, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 78 (1954) 60 and n. 3; cf. Hirschfeld, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Arsinoe 15." Two objections may be raised against this view: <i class="italic">(a)</i> Aetolia never belonged to the Ptolemies, and <i class="italic">(b)</i> all the other Ptolemaic Arsinoes were seaports. (2) Other scholars, pointing to the nearby town of Lysimacheia, suggest either that Arsinoe founded the town while she was the wife of Lysimachos or that Lysimachos himself did it; this would have to be after the latter's conquest of Macedonia and Pyrrhos' retreat to Epirus, i.e., between 284 and 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ; for Lysimachos as founder see, for example, Woodhouse, 214-19. The objections to this hypothesis are <i class="italic">(a)</i> Lysimachos did not actually rule Aetolia, and <i class="italic">(b)</i> Strabo specifics that Arsinoe was the wife of Philadelphos. The counterargument to the second point is that Strabo referred to her this way only as a means of identifying <i class="italic">which</i> Arsinoe he meant. (3) Finally, it has been suggested that the Aetolians themselves founded the city and named it in honor of Arsinoe when she was the wife of Lysimachos (rather than when she was Ptolemy's wife), just as they founded Lysimacheia in his honor; see, for example, Tarn, <i class="italic">AG</i> , 111; Beloch, <i class="italic">GG</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 4.1: 241 n. 2 (see also Flacelière, <i class="italic">Les Aitoliens</i> , 81 n. 2); Tscherikower, 5; P.

Despite Strabo's explicit statement that <b class="bold">Arsinoe</b> founded the town it is possible the Aetolians actually founded the city but considered her the "founder."</p>

We also get an indication of the location of Arsinoe at Angelokastron from the combined evidence of Strabo and Polybius. In addition to telling us that Konope was refounded as an Arsinoe, Strabo adds that it was near Lysimacheia and was "well situated at the ford of the Acheloos" (10.2.22). From Polybius we learn that in 219 and again in 218 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> Philip V crossed the Acheloos (Aspropotamos) River at a spot near Konope. In 218 he crossed the river at a point between the towns of Stratos and Konope (5.6.6)—obviously the same "ford of the Acheloos" he had used in 219 (4.63.11, 64.5). Polybius also adds that after crossing the Acheloos in 218, Philip marched past Konope and the town of Lysimacheia (5.7.7). Finally, in the passage preserved by Athenaeus, Polybius refers to Arsinoe as being near a river called the Kyathos; this was apparently a tributary of the Acheloos (Aspropotamos) that flowed from the lake at Angelokastron (Polyb. 9.45.1 = Ath. 10.424c; see Walbank, <i class="italic"> Comment</i> . on Polyb. 9.45.1; Woodhouse, 210; Leake, <i class="italic">NG</i> , 1: 154; on the Lake Angelokastron [Lisimakhia] see <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Lysimacheia 2"). In fact, the modern village of Angelokastron is in southwestern Aetolia, west of the lake of the same name approximately 2 km from the Acheloos. (On Angelokastron see Soustal and Koder, <i class="italic">TIB</i> III: 108 and map at end.) The ruins near the village are agreed to be those of Arsinoe Konope. Despite the fact that Stephanos places Arsinoe (s.v.) in Aetolia and Konope (s.v.) in Acarnania, there is no reason to doubt that the two were one and the same (so Woodhouse, 213 n. 4, against H. G. Lolling, "Hellenische Landeskunde," in <i class="italic">Müllers Handbuch</i> [Nördlingen, 1889] 3: 139). See the map in Walbank, <i class="italic"> Comment</i> ., 1: 542.</p>

        <p>Demetrios Poliorketes founded Demetrias sometime after 294 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
          <sup class="superscript">1</sup> According to Strabo (9.5.15) the new city was a synoecism consisting of the inhabitants of the towns of Nelia, Pagasai, Ormenion, Rhizous, Sepias, Olizon, Boibe, and Iolkos. At the time of the founding or later Aiole, Halos, Spalauthra, Korope, Kasthanaia, and Amphanai also were included. The strategic importance of the city was frequently noted in antiquity. It was a major fortress, which along with Chalkis and Korinth was considered to be one of the "fetters of Greece." Strabo noted (9.5.15) that the city controlled the Vale of Tempe as well as the mountains Pelion and Ossa and was a naval station. In 197 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> the Greek delegation to Rome claimed that Demetrias controlled Aetolia, Magnesia, and Thessaly and that as long as Demetrias, Chalkis, and Korinth were in Macedonian hands the Greeks could not consider themselves to be free (App. <i class="italic"> Mac</i> . 8; Polyb. 18.11.4-7). Not surprisingly, therefore, Livy described Demetrias as an <i class="italic">urbem validam et ad omnia opportunam</i> (39.23.12).<sup class="superscript">2</sup></p>
        <p>Demetrias was also an important administrative center. Strabo mentions that it was a royal residence (<i class="italic">basileion</i> ) for the Antigonids while Livy (35.31.9) refers to a <i class="italic">regia aedificata</i> at Demetrias.

        <p>The royal residence was apparently built by Philip V and abandoned at the end of Macedonian rule in the area. In the fill of the building seals with the picture of a warrior on the prow of a ship have been found; one of the seals had the inscription <span class="Symbol">D</span> HMHTPIE<span class="Symbol">W</span> N.<sup class="superscript">4</sup> Epigraphic evidence from the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> attests the presence of a sanctuary of the <i class="italic">archegetai</i> and <i class="italic">ktistai</i> at Demetrias.<sup class="superscript">5</sup> In this sanctuary the heroes of the towns that were absorbed in the synoecism as well as the founder were honored. Plutarch says (<i class="italic">Demetr</i> . 53) that Antigonos Gonatas buried his father in Demetrias; quite possibly his grave was at the site of the sanctuary. Demetrias is recorded in the Delphic <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list, which is dated to c. 230-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
          <sup class="superscript">6</sup></p>

On the lake of Lysimacheia (the modern Lake of Angelokastron or Lisimakhia), which Strabo says (10.2.22) was formerly called Hydra, see Bölte, "Lysimacheia 2." Woodhouse's confusion (224-27) of this lake with its eastern neighbor, the modern Lake Agrinion, results from his locating Lysimacheia farther east at Papadates.

        <p>2. Tscherikower suggested it was Philip V who <b class="bold">renamed Philippopolis</b> and that this is "in die Zeit des Krieges der Römer mit Antiochos III. oder gleich darauf anzusetzen" (4); he did not specify any further. Philip V had possession of Gomphoi only from 191 to 185 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Furthermore, Livy still refers to it as Gomphoi in describing the events of 189 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (38.2.11). Thus, if Philip V renamed Gomphoi and if the name in Livy 38.2.11 reflects its usage at the time, then Gomphoi will have been renamed after 189 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and will have reverted to its old name after 185 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> Unfortunately, Tscherikower's case is weakened by the fact that he ignored the numismatic evidence.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Tscherikower, most historians and numismatists have assigned the founding of Philippopolis to the father of Alexander the Great; see, for example, B. Helly, <i class="italic">Gonnoi</i> I: 82 and n. 2. There is no explicit literary or extant epigraphic evidence to support this claim. Nevertheless, recognizing the strategic importance of the town, scholars have assumed that Philip fortified and renamed it. The only supporting evidence for this hypothesis is the silver coinage with the legend <span class="Symbol">F</span> I<span class="Symbol">L</span> I<span class="Symbol">PP</span> O<span class="Symbol">P</span> O<span class="Symbol">L</span> IT<span class="Symbol">W</span> N. On stylistic and historical grounds it is most likely to be dated to the time of Philip II; see E. Muret, 289; C. M. Kraay, <i class="italic">Archaic and Classical Greek Coins</i> (Berkeley, 1976) 119; T. R. Martin, <i class="italic">Sovereignty and Coinage in Classical Greece</i> (Princeton, 1985) 56 and n. 58. <i class="italic">Nota bene</i> , however, Martin's caveat: "The chronology of the coins of Gomphi/Philippopolis is impossible to determine with any accuracy and so the possibility cannot absolutely be ruled out that its coinage was suppressed by Philip at the same time as the coinages of all other Thessalian cities except for Larissa." On the other hand, as Martin (54-56) and Kraay (op. cit. and <i class="italic">Greek Coins and History</i> [London, 1969] 15-16) note, the suppression of Thessalian coinage by Philip after 344 was not as general as once believed (so, for example, P. Collart, <i class="italic"> Philippes</i> [Paris, 1937] 164). Gardner's down-dating of these coins to the time of the Lamian War or of Demetrios Poliorketes (<i class="italic">BMC Thessaly</i> , xxxv-xxxvi, followed by [Hammond and] Griffith, <i class="italic">Macedonia</i> , 2: 540) is not likely. The old name appears again soon after 330 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> in an inscription from Argos (<i class="italic">IG</i> IV.617.10; see Stählin, 126; Westlake, <i class="italic">Thessaly in the Fourth Century</i> [London, 1935] 178).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the problem remains of the (re)appearance of the name Philippopolis in Livy's narrative of the events in 185 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Leake argued unconvincingly (<i class="italic">NG</i> , 4: 364) that Livy meant Phthiotic Thebes, which was also renamed Philip-popolis, rather than Gomphoi. Stählin, on the other hand, suggested (<i class="italic">Hellen. Thessal</i> ., 126 and n. 8) that the name Philippopolis was purposely inserted in the discussion at Tempe by the Macedonian delegates! In this Stählin, who also attributed the renaming to Philip II, apparently assumed that the name had been briefly used a century and a half before, been dormant since, and was then suddenly revived by the Macedonian embassy in 185 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ! In sum, despite the apparently anachronistic—and not easily explained—appearance of "Philippopolis"</p>

        <p>In 223 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Mantineia was captured by the Achaeans with the help of Antigonos Doson. The Achaeans massacred many of the male inhabitants; they enslaved others, as well as the women and children.<sup class="superscript">l</sup> In addition, the wealth of the city was then divided between the Macedonians and the Achaeans on a two to one ratio.

An inscription from Antigoneia (<i class="italic">IG</i> V.2.299), dated to the period between the capture of the city and the death of Doson in the spring of 220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , honors him as <i class="italic">soter</i> and <i class="italic">euergetes</i> .<sup class="superscript">2</sup> The new name soon received general recognition and was used until the emperor Hadrian revived "Mantineia" (Paus. 8.8.12).<sup class="superscript">3</sup> From an Antigoneian inscription that dates to before the Roman takeover in 146 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">IG</i> V.2.263) we learn that the popular assembly was called

        . This had been accepted by most scholars (e.g., Niese, <i class="italic">GMS</i> , 2: 349 n. 3; Tscherikower, 6; Hiller von Gaertringen, 50; Bölte, 1329). Fougères, however, retained the manuscript reading and suggested that after Antigonos gave the city to the Argives they repopulated and annexed it (<i class="italic">Mantinée</i> , 503-4; see also Droysen, <i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 3: 555). He also suggested it was only in 198 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when Philokles, the general of Philip V, removed Argos from Achaean control (Livy 32.25), that Antigoneia became an independent member of the Achaean League (508-9 and n. 4).

        <p>2.

        <p>The possible exception to the use of the new name on inscriptions and coins after 222 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> is the Delphic <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list (Plassart, <i class="italic"> BCH</i> 45 [1921] 13, col. II.113), where "Mantineia" is used. The dating of the list was long a matter of dispute. Plassart (38-44) placed it in the first quarter of the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> His dating was accepted by L. Robert (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 70 [1946] 514-15; in <i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 11-12 [1960] 168, however, Robert preferred to reserve judgment on the question of the date). G. Daux, however, claimed that columns I-III, i.e., the main part of the list, are datable to the period 235-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">REG</i> 62 [1949] 23-27; <i class="italic"> BCH</i> 81 [1957] 393-95; and <i class="italic">BCH</i> 104 [1980] 121). Recent studies have demonstrated that the earlier dating proposed by Daux is almost certainly correct and that the main part of the <i class="italic"> theorodokoi</i> list should be dated to c. 230-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (M. B. Hatzopoulos, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 115 [1991] 345-47; P. Gauthier, <i class="italic">Sardes</i> II: 149-50; C. Habicht, in <i class="italic">Praestant Interna: Festschrift Ulrich Hausmann</i> [Tübingen, 1982] 381). It is probable, therefore, that the list antedates the name change. Crosby and Grace, writing in 1936, (see below, note 5) followed the later dating and suggested that certain Achaean League coins (nos. 86-95) with a trident and the letter M (or the monogram </p>

        <p>There was a garrison of Ptolemaic soldiers stationed in the town.

It was probably in this same period that the walls of the city were rebuilt.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> The city served as an important Ptolemaic harbor; the extensive references in the agreement between Arsinoe and Troizen to the docking facilities at Arsinoe make this quite clear. Strategically located on the peninsula extending out from the Argolid, Arsinoe was an important base for controlling naval traffic in the Saronic Gulf. It was near the present village of Megalochorio.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> Neither the founder nor the date of the founding is known.

        <p>Among the islands of the Propontis Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.151) mentions one called Antioch, which was apparently off the coast of Bithynia. Presumably this is the same island as the one listed by the <i class="italic">Tabula Peutingeriana</i> (IX.1), also in the Propontis, off Constantinople.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> There is no further information available regarding this Antioch. Its precise identification and location are unknown, as is the founder. In any event, a strategically located stronghold in the Propontis would have been useful for securing supply lines to Thrace or for keeping watch over the western Bithynian coast. If it was a Seleucid colony, the question remains as to when it might have been established. Two possible candidates emerge as the most likely founder: Antiochos I at the beginning of his reign, when the Seleucids were conducting naval operations in the Propontis against the Bithynians (Memnon, <i class="italic">FGrH</i> 434 F9-10; Justin 25.1.1), or Antiochos II, when he was besieging the city of Kypsela in Thrace (Polyaenus 4.16) and attacking Byzantion (Memnon, <i class="italic">FGrH</i> 434 F15). Of the two I incline toward the former as the founder of Antioch in the Propontis.<sup class="superscript">2</sup></p>
        <p>1. Tscherikower does not list this Antioch. On the <i class="italic">Tab. Peut</i> . IX.1 see also Miller, <i class="italic">Itineraria Romana</i> , 610, who mentions the Princes' Islands (southeast of Istanbul in the Sea of Marmara) or the former island (now peninsula) of Arktonnesos (Kapu Dag) as possible sites. It is interesting to note, incidentally, that one of the Princes' Islands, Burgaz, was called </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00124.gif"></figure>
         in the Byzantine period: Theophanes Continuatus, p. 398; ps.-Symeon Magister, pp. 642, 732; George Monachos, p. 891 (all in <i class="italic">CSHB</i> XXXIII); an inscription from the island dated to 1063 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> (B. de Montfaucon, <i class="italic">Palaeographia Graeca</i> [Paris, 1708] 52). The modern Greeks called it "Antigoni." See further Dörner, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Panormos 7"; J. Papadopoulos, <i class="italic">Byzantinisch-neugriechische Jahrbücher</i> (1926/27) 81-88.
        <p></p>
        <p>2. The <b class="bold">most likely candidate as founder is Antiochos I</b> . In the early years of his reign he was faced with challenges to his authority in various parts of his empire, including northwest Asia Minor. Very little is known of the events in this region (see, for example, Wilcken, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Antiochos I," 2452-53; Bevan, <i class="italic"> House of Seleucus</i> , 1: 129-35; W. Otto, <i class="italic">ABAW</i> 34 (1928) 17-21; Will, <i class="italic">Hist</i> .<sup class="superscript">2</sup> 1: 109; and Habicht, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Zipoites 1," 453-54). Nevertheless it is clear that Antiochos, concerned with the threat posed by Antigonos Gonatas, the Northern League, and, in particular, Bithynia, conducted operations in the Propontis c. 278 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Hence it is conceivable that, in an effort to reinforce the Seleucid presence in the area, he founded an Antioch there.</p>
        <p>Another possible founder is Antiochos II. During his lifetime the Troad was still controlled by the Seleucids (see, for example, <i class="italic">RC</i> 18-20) and was the home of a</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_132" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">132</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_132"></div>
        <p>number of royal mints (for example at Lampsakos, Abydos, ALEXANDREIA Troas, ILION; also LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace; see Newell, <i class="italic">WSM</i> , 319-51; Houghton, <i class="italic">CSE</i> , 58-61). Polyaenus (4.16) says "Antiochos son of Antiochos" besieged Kypsela in Thrace; presumably this is Antiochos II. Furthermore Droysen suggested (<i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 3: 303-9) that the siege of Kypsela and the attack on Byzantion took place during the same expedition. When this expedition took place is not known. Wilcken (<i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Antiochos II," 2455) believed it happened at the beginning of Antiochos II's reign. Droysen (<i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 3:307 and n. 1) dated it to before 259 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ; see also Bouché-Leclercq (<i class="italic">Hist. Sel</i> ., 77 and n. 1). Niese, <i class="italic">GMS</i> , 2: 137-38, suggested it was around 255 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , while Beloch (<i class="italic">GG</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 4. 1: 672 n. 5) opted for "die letzten Jahre des Antiochos." An Antioch in the Propontis would have been well located to protect travel from the Troad to Byzantion.</p>
        <p>Other possible founders of Antioch are Seleukos I Nikator, Antiochos Hierax, and Antiochos III. After his victory over Lysimachos at Korupedion in 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Seleukos was murdered by Ptolemy Keraunos at a spot near Lysimacheia in Thrace. However, it is unlikely that he would have had the opportunity between Korupedion and his death to found an Antioch in the Propontis.</p>
        <p>Antiochos Hierax died as a fugitive in Thrace around 226 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Polyb. 5.74.4 and Walbank's commentary; Euseb. <i class="italic">Chron</i> . I, p. 253 [ed. Schoene]). There is evidence for extensive activity by mints in the Hellespont under Hierax (see, for example, Newell, <i class="italic">WSM</i> , 321-58; Houghton, <i class="italic">CSE</i> , 58-61; id., <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 23 [1978] 59-68). On the other hand, there is no extant evidence that indicates Hierax founded colonies anywhere in the regions under his control. Furthermore, as a fugitive he would hardly have had the opportunity to establish a settlement! Finally, Antiochos Hierax was also "the son of Antiochos," <i class="italic">i.e</i> ., of Antiochos II. Nevertheless it is unlikely that Hierax would have been besieging or have captured (the MS readings for Polyaenus 4.16 differ between </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00125.gif"></figure>
         and 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00126.gif"></figure>
        ) any city. The death of Hierax removed a Seleucid presence in the Hellespontine region until 196 and 195 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when Antiochos III refounded Lysimacheia and pacified nearby areas. He did not remain long in the region on either of his visits and probably had no occasion to found an Antioch in the Propontis.

         (cf. Strabo 10.4.7) and located Arsinoe near the village of Mallia; later he suggested reading 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00133.gif"></figure>
         and hypothesized that Ptolemy IV Philopator refounded Lyktos (which had been destroyed by Knossos and its allies in 220-219 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ; Polyb. 4.53.3-54.3) not on its original site but on the sea coast (<i class="italic">Ta Nomismata tou Kratous ton Ptolernaion</i> , 1: 308-9; for the mention of Lyttos by the Sea in the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> see <i class="italic">I. Cret</i> . I: 234, ll. 8-10, and pp. 33-34; cf. Le Rider, <i class="italic">Essays S. Robinson</i> , 230 n. 7). Tscherikower suggested (7; see also Longega, 118) Arsinoe was a refounding of the old Lyktos (presumably by Ptolemy IV). R. C. Bosanquet (in a letter cited by H. Schrader, <i class="italic">AM</i> 29 [1904] 111) thought that Lyttos by the Sea referred to Chersonesos, which Strabo describes as the port of Lyktos (10.4.14), and that Chersonesos was renamed Arsinoe for a time; contra, Guarducci, <i class="italic">I. Cret</i> . I: 180; see also Le Rider, 230 n. 9. Guarducci placed Arsinoe in the territory of Lyktos, without specifying the precise location (<i class="italic">I. Cret</i> . I: 180). Le Rider commented (<i class="italic">Monnaies crétoises</i> , 242; see also G. Manganaro, <i class="italic">Studi Levi</i> , 2:50) that if 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00134.gif"></figure>
         is the correct reading, then Arsinoe was probably a coastal town in the territory of Lyktos. It should be noted, however, that Hellenistic foundations were not normally placed in the territory of other cities. But, then, we do not know what kind of settlement this Arsinoe was, nor do we know if Stephanos' text is correct. For a full survey of opinions on the Stephanos passage see Svoronos, <i class="italic"> Numismlique</i> , 29-30; Le Rider, <i class="italic">Essays S. Robinson</i> , 230-31. For other Ptolemaic Arsinoes being harbor towns see L. Robert, <i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 11-12, (1960) 156-57; Le Rider, <i class="italic">Essays S. Robinson</i> , 233 n. 7. The <b class="bold">site of Lyktos</b> is close to the modern village of Xyda (see Le Rider, <i class="italic">Monnaies crétoises</i> , 236 and map at end; Guarducci, <i class="italic">I. Cret</i> . I: 179ff.).
        <p></p>
        <p>2. The identification of the <b class="bold">founder</b> of Arsinoe (see above) remains open. Ptolemy II Philadelphos was, of course, very active in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean as a colonizer: practically all the foundations on Cyprus, the southern Asia Minor coast, and Keos and Methana can, with varying degrees of certainty, be ascribed to him. This raises the strong possibility that Philadelphos also colonized on Crete, as he undoubtedly did on Keos and at Methana during the Chremonidean War. However, for Crete we also have Strabo's comment that Ptolemy IV Philopator (who was married to Arsinoe III) began to rebuild the walls of Gortyna (10.4.11). Whether Philopator's interest in Crete extended to refounding cities we do not know. Certainly he would have had the opportunity to rebuild it after it was destroyed in 220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> However, in the absence of any positive evidence supporting a claim for Philopator it is appropriate</p>

        <p>to identify Philadelphos as the likely founder (see also Huss, <i class="italic">Aussen</i> ., 156 and n. 141)</p>
        <p>3. In his study of the <b class="bold">coinage</b> of Crete, Svoronos attributed four groups of bronzes to the Arsinoe there (<i class="italic">Numismatique</i> , 30-32, nos. 1-14). None can definitely be assigned to Arsinoe Lyktou. Svoronos himself later reassigned nos. 1-4 to ARSINOE Methana (<i class="italic">JIAN</i> 7 [1904] 397-400). More recently, Le Rider has grouped nos. 7-13 with ARSINOE Rhithymna (<i class="italic">Essays S. Robinson</i> , 231ff.).

Thus a Hellenistic amphora found in the area of Paphos bears the name of a shipbuilder (A. H. S. Megaw, <i class="italic">JHS</i> 72 [1952] 115), and a statue base found at Old Paphos (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 39 = T. B. Mitford, <i class="italic">ABSA</i> 56 [1961] 9, no. 17) records the erection of a statue by "King Ptolemy" for [Pyr]goteles son of Zoes, a naval architect who built a <i class="italic"> triakonteres</i> and <i class="italic">eikoseres</i> (a "thirty" and a "twenty" galley). For an explanation of the terms see esp. L. Casson, <i class="italic"> Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient Worm</i> (Princeton, 1971) 137-40; see also R.

On the importance of Paphos for the Ptolemaic naval program see W. A. Daszewski, <i class="italic">RDAC</i> (1987) 171-75. The inscription is dated palaeographically to the second quarter of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and, hence, may be ascribed to Ptolemy Philadelphos. This identification finds strong support in Athenaeus 5.203d-e, who specifically refers to the fact that Philadelphos was the largest shipowner of his day and that, among other ships, he owned two <i class="italic">triakontereis</i> and one <i class="italic"> eikoseres</i> . At the same time it is well to recall that the Ptolemaic Arsinoes on Cyprus (and generally elsewhere) were harbors (see Robert, <i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 11-12 [1960] 155f.). In fact Strabo specifies (14.6.3) that ARSINOE near Palaipaphos had an anchorage, and ARSINOE near Salamis a harbor. Finally, the large number of dedications to Arsinoe Philadelphos found on Cyprus indicates clearly her prominence there (Mitford, <i class="italic">ABSA</i> [1961] 7-9, nos. 12-14, and commentary). Taken together, the available evidence suggests that the three Cypriot Arsinoes were founded by Ptolemy II Philadelphos and named for his wife and sister.

For the <i class="italic">theoroi</i> to have visited Amathous after Ledroi would have involved some minor retracing of steps. On the other hand, if the restoration of "Arsinoe" for l. 9 is accepted, we must ask, which one? Watkin ("The Development of Cities in Cyprus," 419-20) assumes it would have been ARSINOE Marion. This would have involved, as he admits, a major detour for the <i class="italic">theoroi</i> . A demur would not have been necessary, however, if they had gone from Ledroi to Arsinoe near Salamis. Furthermore, as Watkin notes (419), the next recognized destination was Arados on the Syrian coast. Arsinoe near Salamis would have provided an appropriate departure point for the crossing.

        <p>The appearance of Koresia in the <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list is awkward.

Three possibilities have been proposed: (1) Arsinoe was the renamed Poiessa (G. Daux; see above and note 2 for compelling objections to this identification); (2) the Arsinoe in <i class="italic">I.

Robert, <i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 11-12: 168). Robert correctly points out that the original, local toponyms often persisted after a renaming. For example, we have evidence of this at ANTIGONEIA Mantineia and at APAMEIA Kelainai. This last remains the most likely explanation for the situation at Keos.</p>

In favor of Philopator is the fact that he was interested in Crete and that, among other things, he began building the walls of Gortyna (Strabo 10.4. 11). Huss (155) and Fauré (op. cit.) prefer Ptolemy II.</p>
        <p>4. The concentration of <b class="bold">Ptolemaic bronzes in and around Rhithymna</b> : Bagnall suggests it resulted from the presence there of the garrison that was paid in Ptolemaic currency (<i class="italic">Ptol.

        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00148.gif"></figure>
        . The most likely suggestion places Stephanos' Arsinoe in eastern Crete in the territory of Lyktos; see ARSINOE Lyktou. If this is so, then Stephanos cannot be referring to the refounded Rhithymna, and we must conclude that there were two Arsinoes on Crete (Tscherikower, of course, does not list Arsinoe Rhithymna). The second reference, <i class="italic">I. Mag</i> . 21, is an inscription of Magnesia on the Maeander that records eight cities in Crete, among which is an Arsinoe (l. 8). As the list is not in geographical order, it is not possible to know where to locate this city (Le Rider, <i class="italic">Essays S. Robinson</i> , 229; id., <i class="italic">Monnaies crétoises</i> , 242).

Finally, in his list of cities named Berenike, Stephanos (s.v.) gives a fourth that he says was previously called Chios. From this we may conclude that the main city of the island was renamed Berenike in honor of one of Mithridates' wives. The new name is not attested in any extant numismatic or epigraphic sources, nor is it likely that it lasted for a long time. The Roman capture of the city in the following year will doubtless have ended the brief flirtation with the name.</p>

        <p>At some point after 311 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Antigonos Monophthalmos founded Antigoneia in the Troad on the site of the former Sigia (Strabo 13.1.33, 47, 52). The towns included in the synoecism were Kebren and Skepsis (Strabo 13.1.33) and probably Larisa, Kolonai, Hamaxitos, and Neandreia as well (Strabo 13.1.47, 52).<sup class="superscript">1</sup> Quite possibly the founding took place at about the same time as the establishment of the Federation of the Troad, whose center was the temple of Athena at Ilion.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> There is no extant numismatic evidence that can be definitely attributed to Antigoneia and only two inscriptions (one of which is restored) that may possibly refer to it.<sup class="superscript">3</sup></p>
        <p>After the battle of Ipsos (301 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ) this area came under the control of Lysimachos, and the town name was changed to Alexandreia (Pliny <i class="italic">NH</i> 5.124). Strabo says (13.1.26, 47) that Alexandreia included, among other towns, Larisa, Kolonai, Chrysa, Hamaxitos, Kebren, and Neandreia; he adds (13.1.52) that Lysimachos allowed the Skepsians to leave the synoecism. Later, in the third century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> , probably under Antiochos I, Kebren probably gained its freedom and was renamed Antioch.<sup class="superscript">4</sup> Even with the defection of Skepsis and Kebren the territory of Alexandreia was quite large; it included all the coastal region south of Ilion to Cape Lekton. Furthermore, the fact that it had the only real harbor on the west coast of the Troad enhanced the importance of Alexandreia.

        <p>1. The <b class="bold">towns included in the synoecism</b> : Cook notes correctly that Strabo explicitly mentions only Kebren and Skepsis as being in the original synoecism of Antigoneia (<i class="italic">ABSA</i> 83 [1988 14 n. 23). Nevertheless he suggests that Strabo's discussion (13.1.33; also 47 and 52) implies that the other towns were also included in Antigoneia. Since Strabo explicitly lists Skepsis as one of the towns involved and since it was still independent in 311/0 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 5 = <i class="italic"> RC</i> 1, the letter of Antigonos to Skepsis), Antigoneia could not have been founded before that date. Although there is no explicit supporting evidence, Robert suggests that Birytis was also included in the synoecism (<i class="italic">ENG</i> , 31 and n. 1). Cook (356-57), on the basis of the evidence of bronze coins of Birytis, which were probably minted after the end of the fourth century, i.e., after the synoecism, rejects this view.</p>
        <p>2. For the possible connection between the establishment of the <b class="bold">Federation of the Troad</b> and the founding of Antigoneia see, for example, A. Brückner, in W. Dörpfeld, <i class="italic">Troja und Ilion</i> (Athens, 1902) 2: 577-79; Bellinger, <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 7 (1957) 46; id., <i class="italic">Troy: The Coins</i> , 3; Robert, <i class="italic">MAT</i> , 21 n. 2; Cook, 364 Cf., on the other hand, Droysen (<i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 1: 783-85) and Magie (<i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 66), who believe that Alexander began the Federation. On the Federation see ILION.</p>
        <p>3. For a rare bronze with the name "Alexander" that Bellinger suggests may be "the first product of the mint later to be Alexandria Troas" see <i class="italic">Troy: The Coins</i> , 78 and n. 3.

Clearly one of the Hellespontine cities is most likely the one referred to in the Eretrian decree. Robert (<i class="italic">MAT</i> , 68) suggested—on weak grounds—this was Antigoneia in the Troad: <i class="italic">(a)</i> he noted that the name of one of the persons honored, Hippodamos, is also found at Ilion in 77 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">I.

On the other hand, Diodorus says (20.111.3) that in 302 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Demetrios was campaigning in the Hellespont and recovered a number of cities, among them Lampsakos and Parion. Demetrios' presence in this region raises the possibility that the Antigoneians honored by the Eretrians came from either Antigoneia in Mysia or near Daskyleion.</p>
        <p>4. On the question of <b class="bold">the status of Kebren in the third century</b>
          <b class="bold">B.C.</b> see Cook, 338-44; Robert, <i class="italic">ENG</i> , 16-23; and ANTIOCH Kebren. For the possibility that Larisa also withdrew from the synoecism see PTOLEMAIS Larisa. For the coinage of Skepsis after it left the synoecism see J. H. Kagan, <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 29 (1984) 11-24. From the mention of Larisa and Hamaxitos in the Delphic <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list, which was dated to the early second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (A. Plassart, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 45 [1921] 8, col. I.D, ll. 18-19) Robert suggested that at the time these two towns were independent of Alexandreia (<i class="italic">ENG</i> , 34-35). Note, however, that the <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list is now dated to c. 230-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (for the dating see ANTIGONEIA Mantineia). Cook objects (221 n. 2) that Strabo, depending on Demetrius of Skepsis (first half of the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), speaks of these towns (and, incidentally, of Kebren as well) as being in the synoecism of Alexandreia (13-1.47 and 52). Of course it is also possible that the towns had withdrawn from the synoecism at various times during the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and then, subsequently, had rejoined Alexandreia; see also ANTIOCH Kebren. I am not convinced by Cook's other objection that inclusion in the <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list means only that the towns were stopping places for the <i class="italic">theoroi</i> , not necessarily that they were poleis. On the opposing tendencies of polis integration and disintegration in the Hellenistic world see Robert, <i class="italic">ENG</i> , 35-36; Wehrli, 87.</p>

In describing the same operations between Antiochos III and the Romans in the 190s, Livy mentions three cities: Smyrna, Lampsakos, and Alexandreia Troas (35.42.2; at 37.35.2 he gives the cities in the same order and also adds Lysimacheia), while Appian (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 29) refers to Smyrna, Lampsakos, and Alexandreia on the Granikos (Tscherikower, 16 n. 30; Tarn, <i class="italic">Alexander</i> , 2:240). The parallel is clear.
        <p></p>
        <p>Tarn explains (<i class="italic">Alexander</i> , 2:240) that the phrase </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00156.gif"></figure>
         should be translated "of the Granikos" and means that after his victory there Alexander promised to build a city at the site of Alexandreia just as he later promised to rebuild ILION. This "promise," as Tarn himself admits, is unrecorded (240). Tarn's claim that Alexander founded Alexandreia Troas is based on a late tradition recorded only in Stephanos (s.v. "Alexandreia 2") and pseudo-Callisthenes; see for example, the Greek version (3.35), the Armenian (English translation by A. M. Wolohojian, <i class="italic">The Romance of Alexander the Great by Pseudo-Callisthenes</i> [New York, 1969] P. 159, sec. 285), and the Hebrew (English translation by I.J. Kazis, <i class="italic">The Book of the Gests of Alexander of Macedon</i> [Cambridge, 1962] p. 158, sec. 130), which was, in turn, based on a Latin translation of the tenth century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> , <i class="italic">Historia de Preliis</i> , by the archpresbyter Leo of Naples. The Syriac version attributes "Alexandreia in the land of Gelenikos" to Alexander (English translation by E. A. W. Budge, <i class="italic">The History of Alexander the Great, Bring the Syriac Version of Pseudo-Callisthes</i> [Cambridge, 1889] p. 142, 3.24). Tarn is quite right to bring the information in pseudo-Callisthenes to our attention. Nevertheless pseudo-Callisthenes' "Life of Alexander" <i class="italic">is</i> late, even if it was based on an earlier version. Furthermore it is a historical romance, not history. Thus we are left with the information in Stephanos, which is not, in itself, a fully reliable source. Hence I do not find Tarn's claim convincing. Berve (<i class="italic">Das Alexanderreich</i> [Munich, 1926]), incidentally, did not make use of these later lists, nor did he consider Alexandreia Troas to be a foundation of Alexander.

        <p>The town of Kebren underwent a series of changes in the Hellenistic age. Antigonos included it in his new foundation of Antigoneia. After the battle of Ipsos Lysimachos took over control of this region and refounded Antigoneia as Alexandreia (Strabo 13.1.26,33). Later on, perhaps under Antiochos I, Kebren was probably refounded as an Antioch. The evidence for the refounding is numismatic.<sup class="superscript">1</sup></p>
        <p>The appearance of the head of Apollo on the obverse and the ram's head on the reverse—the traditional type of Kebren—on some rare coins, together with</p>

        <p>the legend ANTIOXE<span class="Symbol">W</span> N, prompted Imhoof-Blumer to suggest that Kebren was renamed Antioch. Furthermore, noting the appearance of the letters B and K on the obverse of some of these coins, Robert hypothesized that they referred to Birytis and Kebren. He also pointed out that on coins with B and K the symbol of the club (the reverse type of Birytis) was set next to the ram's head of Kebren. Therefore he concluded that Kebren and Birytis were united in a <i class="italic">Sympoliteia</i> or synoecism and together were included in the territory of the new Antioch.</p>
        <p>We do not know how long the name "Antioch" persisted. Undoubtedly it ceased with the withdrawal of the Seleucids, if not before. In any event, an inscription from Assos, dated palaeographically to the third or second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , twice mentions Kebren.<sup class="superscript">2</sup></p>
        <p>Kebren was located on the Çal Dag. The identification was made on the basis of numerous coins of Kebren found there.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> A precise identification of the site of the Hellenistic settlement of Antioch Kebren has not yet been made.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>The numismatic evidence and the epigraphic evidence of Assos that I have quoted suggest that Kebren gained its freedom from Alexandreia in the course of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and was—briefly—renamed Antioch. This is, at first glance, in conflict with the literary testimony of Strabo, who expressly states (13.1.33) that although Skepsis withdrew from the new city of Alexandreia Troas, Kebren did not (</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00161.gif"></figure>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00162.gif"></figure>
        ). Furthermore Strabo, writing in the first century <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span> (and using the research of Demetrius of Skepsis, who wrote in the early second century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ) describes Kebren as then being in the synoecism of Alexandreia (13.1.47).
        <p></p>
        <p>Cook, following Strabo's account and pointing to <i class="italic">(a)</i> the lack of archaeological evidence on the Çal Dag for a Hellenistic city, <i class="italic">(b)</i> the absence of any reference elsewhere in the Hellenistic world to an Antioch (Kebren) or its citizens or to an independent city of Kebren, and <i class="italic">(c)</i> the lack of any coins of the Antiochenes in the Troad doubted that Kebren was ever reestablished as a <i class="italic">city</i> once it had been absorbed in Alexandreia Troas by Lysimachos (<i class="italic">The Troad</i> , 338-44; <i class="italic"> ABSA</i> 83 [1988] 17-19). However, on the basis of three Alexandreia Troas coins found at Pinarbasi<a name="d0e10691-ref" href="#d0e10691" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          near the Çal Dag and the evidence of the Assos inscription, Cook suggested that even after the synoecism Kebren continued to exist as a <i class="italic">village</i> in the territory of Alexandreia. The village was not at the old site; Cook speculated it may have been near Pinarbasi<a name="d0e10697-ref" href="#d0e10697" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          (contra, L. Robert, <i class="italic">ENG</i> , 16-31; id., <i class="italic">BCH</i> 106 [1982] 322-23 n. 23).</p>
        <p>Strabo's statement (13.1.33) indicates that at the time Skepsis withdrew from the synoecism Kebren remained. This happened in the lifetime of Lysimachos (</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00163.gif"></figure>
        ). There is nothing in Strabo to exclude the possibility that at some later date—under Antiochos I—Kebren also withdrew (Robert, <i class="italic">ENG</i> , 21). Strabo's further comment (13.1.47) that Kebren belonged to the synoecism of Alexandreia may simply mean that by the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Kebren had rejoined Alexandreia Troas. Finally, the absence of any reference elsewhere in the Hellenistic world to Antioch (Kebren) or Antiochenes is not extraordinary: the refounding of Rhithymna as an ARSINOE, for example, is known only from local, civic coinage; neither Arsinoe nor its citizens are mentioned elsewhere in the extant evidence. The absence of coins of the Antiochenes in the Troad is possibly bothersome, but it is "negative evidence," as Cook says (<i class="italic">ABSA</i> 83 [1988] 18-19).

        <p>3. The discovery and identification of the <b class="bold">Çal Dag as the site of Kebren</b> was made by E Calvert, who published his findings in <i class="italic">Arch. Journal</i> 22 (1865) 53-57 (description of the site, including the remains of a circuit wall; according to Calvert, of seventy-one coins found at the site itself and the immediate vicinity, twenty-five were of Kebren); further on the location see Cook, 327-40, map on p. 273, and literature cited on p. 327 n. 2; for a photograph see Cook, pl. 59a.</p>
        <p>As for the <b class="bold">location of Antioch</b> , Cook surmised "it was a settlement of exiles at a distance from their old home" (344). He noted the absence of Antioch coins from the Çal Dag and, in fact, from the Troad. The provenience of the Antioch coinage, it should be noted, is apparently not known (Cook, 338 n. % following Robert). Cook suggested that a dedication of Roman date from the vicinity of Kyzikos to Dionysos Kebrenios might "offer a clue" to the location of Antioch (344 n. 1); contra, L. Robert, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 106 (1982) 322-23 n. 23, who suggested that Antioch may have been centered at Birytis rather than at Kebren. Note, however, that the location of Birytis is not secure: L. Robert has argued it was close to Kebren (<i class="italic">ENG</i> , 25-30; <i class="italic">MAT</i> , 108-9; cf. <i class="italic"> BCH</i> 106 [1982] 323 n. 23). Cook (356-57) would look for it "in the northwest Troad in the close vicinity of Ilion."</p>

        <p>According to Strabo (13.1.58), "the kings" increased the depleted population of Gargara by transferring colonists from Miletoupolis after they had devastated the latter city. Unfortunately Strabo does not specify who "the kings" were.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> It is reasonable to suppose, however, that he was referring in this instance to the Attalid royal house. In any event, Strabo says the result of the population transfer was to reduce the Gargarans to "semi-barbarians." We may note in passing a prominent citizen of Gargara: Malousios, who made significant benefactions to the Federation of the Troad at ILION at the end of the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup></p>
        <p>The precise location of Gargara is not yet known. According to Stephanos (s.v. "Gargara") and the <i class="italic">Etymologicum Magnum</i> (s.v.

Pliny says (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.122) <i class="italic">intus mons Gargara eodemque nomine oppidum</i> .

        ), comments that in the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Gargara was still "perched on its hill." He says "this confirms it was only brought down to the coast under Pergamene rule" (262). However, the epigram could apply just as easily to either site. And, according to Cook (259), pottery found at the two sites (assuming they are correctly identified) suggests a date in the second half of the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> for the move. At the very least we must distinguish between the removal of the town to its new site and the transfer of the Miletoupolitan population. What the connection was—if any—between these two undertakings is not clear.

Jones (<i class="italic">Public Organization</i> , 300) noted that the tribe Panthoïs probably referred to the Trojan elder PanthoÖs. Following a suggestion of Frisch (<i class="italic">I. Ilion</i> , p. 225), Jones hypothesized that the tribe Alexandris alluded to the Trojan Pads (Alexander) rather than to the Macedonian king. Support for this interpretation may be seen in the discovery in Theater A at Ilion of a marble block with the inscription <span class="Symbol">D</span> HI<span class="Symbol">F</span> O (C. B. Rose, <i class="italic">Studia Troica</i> 3 [1993] 105). The most likely restoration would refer to Deiphobos, Priam's son, or possibly a tribe named for him. Other examples of tribal names in theaters can be seen at HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia and Stobi (J. Wiseman, <i class="italic">Stobi: A Guide to the Excavations</i> [Belgrade, 1973] 71). On the other hand, the fact that Alexander the Great made so many benefactions to Ilion and the pride that cities took in finding a connection, real or imagined, with the Macedonian king raise the possibility that the tribe was named for him rather than for the Trojan hero.</p>

        <p>3. With regard to Lykourgos' description of Ilion as "uninhabited," Bellinger correctly pointed out (<i class="italic">Troy: The Coins</i> , 2 n. 14) that this is "rhetorical exaggeration; nevertheless it would not have been used of a city in a notable period of rebuilding."</p>

For Antigonos as founder of the Federation see Haubold, 62f.; Brückner, 577-78; Robert, 21 n. 2; cf. Droysen (<i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 1: 783-85, 2: 659), who believed Alexander established it. The inscription honoring Malousios (<i class="italic">Syll</i> .<sup class="superscript">3</sup> 330 = <i class="italic">I. Ilion</i> 1), which is the first notice of the Federation, is dated to c. 306/5 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> by the fact that in decree I (l. 9) Antigonos is referred to by name only, while in decree II (1. 24) he is simply called "the king." Presumably the first decree was drawn up just before 306/5 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , and the second shortly after. Cf. E Verkinderen, <i class="italic">Tyche</i> 2 (1987) 247-69, who disputes the identification of Antigonos with "the king." Reversing the order of the inscription, he argues—interestingly, but not persuasively—that "the king" is Alexander and that the inscription should be dated to 334 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> For the various names of the Federation and its members see Magic, 869-70; Robert, 15f.</p>
        <p>The controversy over the <b class="bold">date of the Athena temple and its sculptural decoration</b> is an old one. Strabo (13.1.26; cf. Diod. 18.4.5-6) attributed it to Lysimachos. However, doubts have been expressed about his reliability because of the possibility that he conflated information about Ilion and ALEXANDREIA Troas; on which see the latter. Schliemann, for example, followed Strabo and attributed the temple to Lysimachos (<i class="italic">Troja</i> [Leipzig, 1884] 224). On the other hand, an architrave block from the temple that bears Augustus' (partly restored) title (<i class="italic">I. Ilion</i> 84) raises the possibility that he built or restored it; see, for example, E W. Goethert (in Goethert and Schleif, <i class="italic">Der Athenatempel von Ilion</i> [Berlin, 1962] 34-42). In general see B. M. Holden, <i class="italic"> The Metopes of the Temple of Athena at Ilion</i> (Northampton, Mass., 1964) esp. 1-5, 29-31; J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">BE</i> (1964) 424; H. Jucker, <i class="italic">AA</i> (1969) 248-56; B. S. Ridgway, <i class="italic"> Hellenistic Sculpture</i> (Madison, Wis., 1990) 1: 150-54, 199-200; C. B. Rose, <i class="italic">Studia Troica</i> 2 (1992) 45-46.</p>
        <p>5. Strabo does not indicate which towns were included in <b class="bold"> Lysimachos' synoecism</b> . Those that might have been absorbed include </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00167.gif"></figure>
        , Skamandreia, Sigeion, Achilleion, Thymbra, Glykeia, Kenchreai, and villages of the Simois valley (L. Robert, <i class="italic">ENG</i> , 8 n. 2 and references). Cook's conjecture includes Sigeion, Birytis, Gentinos, and, probably, Achilleion (364 and map on p. 365; Cook also speculates that Skamandreia was later "attached to Ilion in a sympolity"). Later, in 188 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , Rome added Rhoiteion and Gergis to Ilion (Livy 38.39.10). It is not clear whether Gergis (<i class="italic">RC</i> 10.6 = <i class="italic">I. Ilion</i> 33.23 = <i class="italic"> OGIS</i> 221.23) did (so Dittenberger commenting on <i class="italic">OGIS</i> 221 followed by Welles commenting on <i class="italic">RC</i> 10) or did not (so Droysen, <i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 1: 782) belong to Ilion c. 274 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when Antiochos I gave some royal land to Aristodikides. <i class="italic">RC</i> 10.6 says only that land from property adjacent to Gergis or Skepsis was to be made available to Aristodikides. The land given to him was then to be joined to Ilion or Skepsis. If Gergis did belong to Ilion

        <p><b class="bold">Strabo's account of the new wall</b> that was built by Lysimachos (13.1.26) is a major crux, for in the next section (13.1.27) he says that in the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Ilion was an unwalled village whose homes lacked tiled roofs. It is possible that many of the towns that had been included in Lysimachos' synoecism broke away not long after the founding. Nevertheless, Strabo's claim that Ilion reverted to an unwalled village is inconsistent with other evidence, both literary and archaeological: <i class="italic">(a)</i> Polybius (5.111.2), who says that the city resisted a siege by Gauls in 216 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , <i class="italic">(b)</i> Livy (37.37.2), who describes how the Scipios encamped on open, flat ground under the walls of Ilion in 190 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , and <i class="italic">(c)</i> the archaeological evidence for a wall dating from the early Hellenistic period.</p>
        <p>For a succinct statement of the problem of the forty-stade wall and references see Magie, 923; Bellinger, <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 7 (1957) 44-48. Briefly, Grote, in his <i class="italic">History of Greece</i> (London, 1888) 1: 297 n. 1, objected that Strabo was inconsistent; at 13.1.26 he says Lysimachus provided Ilion with a forty-stade wall, but at 13.1.27, following Hegesianax and Demetrius of Skepsis, he describes it as "unwalled" at the time of the Galatian invasion of 278 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , and as a </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00168.gif"></figure>
         in 190 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Grote therefore suggested that at 13.1.26 Strabo "really meant to speak only of the improvements brought about by Lysimachus in <i class="italic">Alexandreia Troas</i> ; that he never meant to ascribe to Lysimachus any improvements in <i class="italic"> Ilium</i> ," and accordingly he emended the text of Strabo. In support of Grote, Dörpfeld (207) pointed out that Hellenistic Ilion was not big enough to have occupied an area surrounded by a forty-stade wall. Finally, Leaf pointed out (142-44) that "there was no trace whatever of any great wall at Ilium" but that Alexandreia Troas had a wall of forty stades. Thus he also followed Grote's suggestion and, in support of this, provided his own textual emendation. Contra, Brückner, 582; Tscherikower, 17-18; L. Robert, <i class="italic">ENG</i> , 7-8; see also R. Merkelbach, <i class="italic"> ZPE</i> 23 (1976) 241-42. Now in addition to the philological arguments against the proposed emendations (noted by L. Robert, <i class="italic"> ENG</i> , 7 and n. 4), the discovery by Blegen of a Hellenistic wall at Ilion—even if it was less than forty stades (<i class="italic">AJA</i> 39 [1935] 26, 564; 41 [1937] 594)—suggests that Lysimachos did in fact build a wall at Ilion.

        <p>In his book on the Troad published in 1973, J. M. Cook mentioned the discovery at Liman Tepe—the likely site of the ancient Larisa—of a coin that had the head of Apollo on the obverse and on the reverse, an amphora or crater with a bird on the groundline and the legend [<span class="Symbol">P</span> T]O<span class="Symbol">L</span> E[MAIE<span class="Symbol">W</span> N].<sup class="superscript">1</sup> Cook noted that other coins of this type are known and, though ascribed to PTOLEMAIS Lebedos, still seemed to be "homeless." He further remarked on the similarity of the coin to those of Larisa in the Troad but commented that "it would be a bold man who would claim this coin as evidence of a third-century refoundation of Larisa under the Ptolemies."</p>
        <p>L. Robert has since made the claim that Larisa was renamed Ptolemais for a time. He based this conclusion on the similarity of coin types and the find location at Liman Tepe. Furthermore he argued that coins with the ethnic <span class="Symbol">P</span> TO<span class="Symbol">L</span> EMAIE<span class="Symbol">W</span> N or <span class="Symbol">P</span> TO<span class="Symbol">L</span> E and an amphora but without a magistrate's name, previously grouped with other Ptolemais foundations, should be classed with Ptolemais Larisa.<sup class="superscript">2</sup></p>
        <p>The Ptolemies probably first gained control of the Hellespont during the Third Syrian War (246-141 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ).<sup class="superscript">3</sup> In the Delphic <i class="italic"> theorodokoi</i> list, now dated to c. 230-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , the name Larisa appears.<sup class="superscript">4</sup> Furthermore, by the time of Ptolemy IV Philopator most of the Troad had slipped from Ptolemaic control. Hence, if Larisa was renamed Ptolemais, it would presumably have been for a short period in the decade after the Third Syrian War. The founder, therefore, would have been Ptolemy III Euergetes I.</p>

These coins have been assigned to various cities, among them PTOLEMAIS Lebedos, PTOLEMAIS in Pamphylia, and PTOLEMAIS in Carla. For the attribution of these coins to Larisa in the Troad see L. and J. Robert, <i class="italic"> JS</i> (1976) 175 n. 87; L. Robert, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 106 (1982) 319-31.</p>
        <p><b class="bold">Larisa</b> had been included in ALEXANDREIA Troas, which was founded by Lysimachos (Strabo 13.1.47). Hence the founding of Ptolemais would have entailed the withdrawal of Larisa from the synoecism. Presumably Larisa was later reabsorbed in Alexandreia: Strabo, writing in the early part of the first century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> but relying on Demetrius of Skepsis, who lived in the first half of the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , described Larisa as being in the synoecism of Alexandreia (13.1.47).</p>
        <p>2. Cook objected to the Roberts' claim that Larisa was refounded as a Ptolemais (see articles cited above, "In general") on two grounds: <i class="italic">(a)</i> in the Delphic <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list Larisa is listed under its old name, whereas Lebedos is still listed as PTOLEMAIS, and <i class="italic">(b)</i> Larisa lies between ALEXANDREIA Troas and Hamaxitos, and "it is generally agreed that Hamaxitos was incorporated from the beginning in the synoecism" (<i class="italic">ABSA</i> 83 [1988] 15). To the first point we may reply that the fact that Lebedos in Ionia is listed as "Ptolemais" does not necessarily reflect on the situation in the Troad. It is possible that at the time of the <i class="italic">theorodokoi</i> list, now dated to c. 230-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (see below, note 4), Larisa had slipped away from Ptolemaic control; on the duration of Ptolemaic control in the Troad see below, note 3. Regarding the second point, the situation created by an independent Ptolemais interposing itself between Alexandreia and Hamaxitos (assuming Hamaxitos is correctly located; see Cook, <i class="italic">ABSA</i> 83 [1988] 15) is awkward but not unexampled: the Polish corridor separating Germany and East Prussia after World War I immediately comes to mind.</p>
        <p>3. In the Adoulis inscription (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 54.14-15) Ptolemy III claimed the <b class="bold">Hellespont</b> as one of the areas he conquered during the Third Syrian War. Huss is of the opinion that by the time of Ptolemy IV Philopator the Ptolemies no longer controlled any city in the Troad (<i class="italic">Aussen</i> ., 209). However, Polybius (5-34.7) indicates that under Philopator the Ptolemies still held the most important cities, places, and harbors "all along the coast from Pamphylia to the Hellespont and the places around Lysimacheia." What the Ptolemies actually controlled in the Hellespont at this time is not dear. In any event it did not include Lampsakos, Alexandreia Troas, and Ilion; these three cities had in 217 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> already been friendly with Attalos I for some time and remained so afterward (Polyb. 5.78.6).

        <p>Louis Robert has suggested that coins with the legend A<span class="Symbol">G</span> A, A<span class="Symbol">G</span> A<span class="Symbol">Q</span> , or A<span class="Symbol">G</span> A<span class="Symbol">Q</span> O and dated to 300 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> belong not to Agathopolis in Thrace but rather to a previously undetected Agathokleia or Agathopolis in Mysia. The settlement would have been named for Lysimachos' son Agathokles. Pointing to a similarity in coin types, Robert has also suggested <i class="italic">(a)</i> that Agathokleia was the refounded Miletoupolis and <i class="italic"> (b)</i> that in turn it was later renamed Antioch. In the absence of confirming evidence we must consider these suggestions regarding Agathokleia as speculative.</p>
        <p><b class="bold">In general</b> see L. Robert, <i class="italic">RPh</i> 33 (1959) 172-79; id., <i class="italic">HSCP</i> 81 (1977) 12; J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">BE</i> (1969) 85; AGATHOPOLIS in Thrace and ANTIOCH in Mysia.</p>
        <p>Regarding <b class="bold">Agathokles</b> , J. and L. Robert pointed out that since Lysimachos named cities for himself and other members of his family (e.g., LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, NIKAIA, EURYDIKEIA, and ARSINOE Ephesos) it is reasonable to expect a city was also named for his son (<i class="italic">BE</i> [1969] 85). The Roberts also claimed that the male head on the coins is that of Agathokles, "as founder."</p>

Gaebler, <i class="italic">ZfN</i> 34 (1924) 310 Robert (<i class="italic">RPh</i> [1959] 175-78) denied the attribution of the coins to the Thracian Agathopolis for the following reasons: <i class="italic">(a)</i> if Agathopolis was a Thracian coastal town in antiquity, it is incomprehensible that no evidence is extant for it in any of the ancient geographers or explorers—an <i class="italic">argumentum ex silentio</i> , as Robert admits; <i class="italic">(b)</i> the coin types (obv.: young male with fillet, rev.: owl or double owl, laurel or caduceus, with the legend A<span class="Symbol">G</span> A, etc.) are unique for cities of the Thracian Chersonese or the coast of Bulgaria; <i class="italic">(c)</i> the coins published by Borrell come from two different collections from Smyrna; and <i class="italic">(d)</i> no Agathopolis coins have been found in Bulgarian collections.</p>
        <p>In support of his removal of the Agathopolis coins to Mysia, L. Robert referred to the article published by Gaebler (op. cit.) in 1924. There Gaebler mentioned a coin with the head of a young man bound with a fillet—stylistically the same as that of the Agathopolis coinage—on the obverse and on the reverse, the <i class="italic"> protome</i> of a winged horse and the legend A<span class="Symbol">G</span> A<span class="Symbol">Q</span> (previously this had been read as <span class="Symbol">L</span> IN). Gaebler pointed out that the reverse type was also to be seen on coins of Lampsakos in Mysia. As a result this particular coin had previously been classed with Linos, a Mysian coastal town near Lampsakos. Robert, however, seized on the new reading of the legend and used this as the basis for transferring the Agath(opolis) coins to Mysia. He also pointed out that the double owl on the reverse that is found on coins of Agath(opolis) is also the most frequently used reverse type on coins of Miletoupolis in Mysia; see J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">BE</i> (1960) 236 and (1969)</p>

        <p>Our only evidence for Antigoneia is Stephanos (s.v. "Antigoneia"). He says it was a "fortress" (</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00171.gif"></figure>

Billows has suggested that Antigonos Monophthalmos founded the four Hellespontine ANTIGONEIAS (Kyzikene, Alexandreia Troas, near Daskyleion, and Nikaia) to control the area after the rebellion of Phoinix in 310 and, perhaps, to counter Lysimachos' new Thracian settlement of LYSIMACHEIA.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> We do not know the precise location of Antigoneia.<sup class="superscript">3</sup>

        <p>1. The phrase "<b class="bold">Western Sea</b> " is a problem. In Strabo (13.1.5) it refers to the Aegean and the "outer Hellespont" (the latter phrase apparently refers to the far northern part of the open Aegean; Strabo at 13.1.19 speaks of Kolonai on the west coast of the Troad as being on the "outer Hellespontine Sea"; see the discussion in Leaf, <i class="italic">Strabo on the Troad</i> , 50-52); but there is no available evidence to indicate that Kyzikene territory ever extended to within fifty stades of the "outer Hellespont" (see Hasluck, 114). Radet suggested that the phrase "Western Sea" referred to the Propontis (<i class="italic">De Coloniis</i> , 11; followed by Tscherikower, 18).</p>
        <p>2. On the <b class="bold">strategic significance of the four Antigoneias</b> see Billows, 304-5.</p>
        <p>3. There is no extant evidence to indicate firmly the location of Antigoneia. Relying on the figure of fifty stades, Radet suggested that Antigoneia was located south of Kyzikos, between it and Lake Manyas (Kus<a name="d0e11857-ref" href="#d0e11857" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          Gölü), at the site of the modern village of Debleki (<i class="italic">De Coloniis</i> , 11, followed by Wehrli). Relying on the same figure of fifty stades, Billows, on the other hand, has suggested it was located at the site of the village of Erdek on the southwest coast of the Kyzikene peninsula (29a-99).</p>
        <p>A decree of Eretria honors three Antigoneians who were friends of Demetrios Poliorketes (<i class="italic">Syll</i> .<sup class="superscript">3</sup> 348). Unfortunately there is no indication which Antigoneia this was. However, we do know that in 302 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Demetrios was campaigning in the Hellespont. At that time, according to Diodorus, he recovered Lampsakos, Parion, and a number of other cities that had "changed sides" (20.111.3). Thus if Antigonos</p>

        <p>On the basis of numismatic evidence Louis Robert has posited the existence of another Antioch in northeast Asia Minor in addition to Antioch Kebren. Pointing to a similarity in type of the coins of Miletoupolis, Agathokleia, and Antioch, Robert has suggested that Miletoupolis was refounded first as Agathokleia and later as Antioch.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> Confirmation for the existence of this Antioch and of its relation to Miletoupolis and Agathokleia must await further corroborative evidence.</p>

        <p>1. In 1949 L. Robert suggested there was another Antioch in northwest Asia Minor in addition to Antioch Kebren (<i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 7:211 n. 3). Two years later he suggested (<i class="italic">ENG</i> , 23-24) that some coins with a diademed head on the obverse and a double owl with the legend ANTIOXE<span class="Symbol">W</span> N on the reverse, previously attributed by Heichelheim to ANTIOCH Kebren (<i class="italic">Hesperia</i> 13 [1944] 361-63), might be attributed to Miletoupolis in Mysia. The latter had as its most frequent reverse type the double owl. Thus Robert tentatively presented the hypothesis that it was Miletoupolis that had been refounded as an Antioch. Furthermore the coinage of his hypothetical AGATHOKLEIA in Mysia also had as one of its main reverse types an owl or double owl. L. Robert noticed this similarity and described Miletoupolis as "qui fur sans doute un temps une Antiocheia et peut-être auparavant une Agathocleia" (<i class="italic">ATAM</i> , 89 n. 572; J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">BE</i> [1969] 85; contra, E. Schwertheim, <i class="italic">I. Kyzikos</i> II: p. 117 and n. 118).

We do not know for certain who the founder was, the identity of the <i class="italic">chorion</i> whence the settlers came,<sup class="superscript">1</sup> or the location of the new colony. A provisional reconstruction would suggest that Attalos I founded the colony after his expedition of 218 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
        <sup class="superscript"> 2</sup> The new foundation of Gergitha was possibly located at a village named Gertze (Yirce) in the middle Kaikos valley.<sup class="superscript">3</sup>

        <p>1. Two possibilities have been suggested for <b class="bold">the place whence the colonists carne</b> : Gergithion in the territory of Lampsakos (Strabo 13.1.19) and Gergis near Ilion. The problem of identifying Gergis and indicating its relation to Gergithion is compounded by (1) Strabo's failure to indicate at 13.1.70 which <i class="italic">chorion</i> Attalos destroyed in order to found the new Gergitha, (2) his confusion in the account of Gergithion in the Troad (13.1.19), and (3) his omission of any reference to Gergis in the Troad (for Gergis and Gergithion see, for example, Stephanos s.v.

In fact one should recall that Gerg- toponyms are quite widespread in western Asia Minor. Hence the name Gergitha may not necessarily derive from Gergithion or Gergis.</p>
        <p>2. For the <b class="bold">founding of the colony</b> by Attalos I after 218 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> see Hansen, 175. Tscherikower (19) and Radet (<i class="italic">La Lydie</i> , 306) suggest that the same monarch established the colony after his victory over the Gauls in the area of the sources of the Kaikos c. 238/7 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (for the date see Allen, <i class="italic">Attalid Kingdom</i> , 198). But as Hansen points out (42 n. 83) Attalos had no relations with the Troad at this early time. Niese (<i class="italic">GMS</i> , 3:64 n. 3) believed the founder was Attalos II. Magie's passing suggestion (742) that at 13.1.19 "Attalos" may be a mistake for "Antiochos" is unlikely.</p>
        <p>3. For the <b class="bold">location</b> of the new Gergitha, Radet suggests Ghelembeh (<i class="italic">La Lydie</i> , 306); Philippson (<i class="italic">Reisen</i> , 1: 67-68) and von Diest (<i class="italic">Von Perg</i> ., 17) hypothesize it was Gertze (Yirce) which could be a survival of the ancient name.</p>

        <p>In his enumeration of towns of Aeolis that no longer existed in his day, Pliny mentions Lysimacheia between Kanai and Atarnea (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.122). This is all that is known about Lysimacheia. The location of Kanai and Atarnea on the Aeolic coast opposite the southern part of Lesbos suggests that Lysimacheia was likewise in this region.

In an apparent attempt to locate Lysimacheia, Tscherikower (20 n. 53) calls attention to the fact that in the section preceding the one under discussion (i.e., <i class="italic">NH</i> 5.121) Pliny mentions an Attaleia among a number of Aeolian cities inland from Kyme and Myrina. However, this is based on a variant reading. As Tscherikower admits, the more likely reading is "Itale"; see the Teubner text (ed. C. Mayhoff [1906; reprint, Stuttgart, 1967]). Schuchhardt (<i class="italic">Alt. v. Perg</i> . 1: 118) tentatively suggested that Lysimacheia was on the Kanai Peninsula, possibly at the modern Hatiplar.</p>

Kleiner dated the Alexanders between 202/1 and 189/8 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ; Boehringer, followed by Mørkholm, dated the beginning of the coinage to c. 220-210 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> The latter dating is preferable.</p>
        <p>8. The minting of coins with the portrait of Philetairos probably continued at least into the 180s <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> and overlapped with the earliest cistophori; see, for example, G. Le Rider, <i class="italic">JS</i> (1989) 169-72; R. Bauslaugh, <i class="italic"> NC</i> (1990) 60-61; H. Nicolet-Pierre, in <i class="italic">KME</i> , 209-12 (the latter suggests that the minting of coins with the Philetairos portrait continued to the 150s). On the problem of dating the introduction of the cistophori see STRATONIKEIA in Lydia. For the <b class="bold">cistophori</b> of Pergamon see Kleiner-Noe, <i class="italic">ECC</i> , 22-40.

        <p>I should mention here a fragmentary inscription of the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> found at Pergamon, which deals with the affairs of an Attalid military colony that was apparently near the capital (<i class="italic">I. Perg</i> . 158 = <i class="italic">RC</i> 51; see also <i class="italic">RC</i> 16). Very briefly, the inscription mentions different size allotments; it distinguishes between vine and cleared land and records the tax rate for each type. The document indicates that some plots of land were sold outright to the settlers and that childless colonists could bequeath their allotments upon payment of the inheritance taxes. The inscription also deals with the maintenance of the temples and the gymnasium. On this important document see Welles, <i class="italic">AJA</i> 42 (1938) 248 (on cleared land) and his commentary on <i class="italic">RC</i> 51; Hansen, <i class="italic"> Attalids</i>

        <p>B. Virgilio has argued that there was a military colony at Pergamon (<i class="italic">Studi ellenistici</i> 1 [1984] 34-36). He points to Strabo 13.4.2, who, in discussing the achievements of Eumenes II, remarks: </p>

        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00177.gif"></figure>
        . Virgilio claimed that the use of the term <i class="italic">katoikia</i> along with the evidence of <i class="italic">RC</i> 51 and <i class="italic">OGIS</i> 338 provides information for the existence of a military colony at Pergamon. However, in Strabo the term <i class="italic">katoikia</i> is used generally to describe a settlement or town. It is not used specifically to refer to a military colony (see, in general, L. Robert, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 109 [1985] 481-84; cf. id., <i class="italic">Ét. anat</i> ., 191-94).

        <p>2. Magie suggests the <b class="bold">location</b> of Philetaireia was on the eastern side of the Ida range, since the western side was probably under the control of Skepsis at the time (<i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 734); Allen (<i class="italic">Attalid Kingdom</i> , 23) places it "somewhat north of the Adramyttene Gulf, in the south-east of the Troad"; see also Virgilio, 113 (between Antandros and Adramyttion), who emphasizes its strategic importance in controlling access from the Troad to Mysia.</p>
        <p>3. For the suggestion that Philetairos was the <b class="bold">founder</b> of Philetaireia by Ida see Allen, <i class="italic">ABSA</i> 66 (1971) 3; id., <i class="italic"> Attalid Kingdom</i> , 24 (followed by Schalles, <i class="italic"> Untersuchungen</i> , 32). Briefly, Allen argues as follows: Eumenes I ascended the throne in 263 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Since his agreement with the mercenaries at Philetaireia and Attaleia used Seleucid dating, it had to have been written before the battle of Sardis; this battle must date to the period between 263 and 261 (Antiochos I's death). Hence Allen concludes that these two settlements were begun before Eumenes' accession. This conclusion does not, however, necessarily follow. It will be recalled that Philetairos followed a general policy of avoiding conflict with the Seleucids. One wonders if the establishment of a military colony would not have been considered provocative by the Seleucids. Eumenes I followed a much more aggressive policy vis-à-vis the Seleucids. It is quite possible, therefore, that Eumenes founded Philetaireia and Attaleia as well very early in his reign, i.e., in the period between his accession and the battle of Sardis. For Eumenes I as the possible founder see, for example, Tscherikower, 18; Hoffmann, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Philetairos," 2161; Hansen, <i class="italic">Attalids</i>

         (ll. 20, 55). The name Philetaireia (without "by Ida") is also found in two other Attalid inscriptions. The first, a dedication made by Diogenes the son of Epikles, mentions a Eumeneion (<i class="italic">I.

A number of scholars have assumed that they arc one and the same town. Hence they have seen the existence of a Eumeneion as proof that Eumenes was considered the founder (<i class="italic">ktistes</i> ) of Philetaireia by Ida (see, for example, Fräankel's commentary on <i class="italic">I. Perg</i> . 13.2; G. Cardinali, <i class="italic">Il regno di Pergamo</i> [Rome, 1906] 14-15; Meyer, <i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 97-99; Tscherikower, 18).</p>
        <p>However, another Pergamene inscription (<i class="italic">IGR</i> IV.292 = H. Hepding, <i class="italic">AM</i> 32 [1907] 245-47; see the commentary on pp. 254-55) records a decree passed in 69 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> or before (on the date see the important discussion of C.

It mentions a procession (11. 40-43) that was to go from Pergamon to Diodoros' <i class="italic">temenos</i> , the Diodoreion, in Philetaireia on the dedication day. Clearly <i class="italic">this</i> Philetaireia was either in or very close to Pergamon and must be distinguished from Philetaireia by Ida, which was more than a day's march away (L. Robert, REA [1934] 524; Boehringer and Krauss, <i class="italic"> Alt. v. Perg</i> . IX: 89-90; Hansen, <i class="italic">Attalids</i>

Since the Eumeneion mentioned in the Diogenes inscription could have been located in Philetaireia near or in Pergamon rather than in Philetaireia by Ida, its existence cannot serve as evidence for positing the <i class="italic">ktistes</i> of the latter town. Schalles, in fact, suggested that the Eumeneion was a <i class="italic">temenos</i> for a posthumous cult of the deified Eumenes II (<i class="italic">Untersuchungen</i> , 32).

        <p>In his enumeration of towns and peoples in Mysia Pliny mentions the "Poemaneni Macedones Asculacae" (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.123). Based on Pliny, one could assign the "Macedones" either to "Poemaneni" or to "Asculacae." Most scholars punctuate without comment between Poemaneni and Macedones Asculacae. However, Radet and Tscherikower have called attention to two entries in Stephanos, "Poimanenon" and "Poimen."<sup class="superscript">1</sup> Under the second, Stephanos mentions a mountain, Poimenion, in Macedonia. Under the first he refers to Poimanenon as a <i class="italic">polis</i> or <i class="italic">phrourion</i> and <i class="italic">chorion</i> of Kyzikos. It is possible, therefore, that Poimanenon was founded as a Macedonian colony.

Keil [Berlin, 1908] pp. 426-27) distinguishes the springs on the Aisepos ("certainly" at Gönen) from the temple of Asklepios at Poimanenon, which lay "on his way thither." Poimanenon is listed as Phemenio, on the road from Kyzikos to Pergamon, in the <i class="italic">Tab. Peut</i> .

        <p>Around 294 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> control of Ephesos passed from Demetrios Poliorketes to Lysimachos.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> It appears that shortly after this Lysirnachos renamed it Arsinoe after his wife and began building a new city.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> As the old site no longer provided access to the sea (due to the silting of the Kayster River), Lysimachos rebuilt the city at a new location to the southeast, in the area between the Bülbüldag and the Panayirdag. He also built a wall of over nine kilometers to enclose the city<sup class="superscript">3</sup> and—probably at the same time—reconstituted the <i class="italic">gerousia</i> .<sup class="superscript">4</sup> The Ephesians were reluctant to move (Strabo 14.1.21) probably because the new site was located in an area that included archaic graves. Nevertheless Lysimachos was able, by a ruse, to move the inhabitants;<sup class="superscript">5</sup> in addition he brought other settlers from Kolophon and Lebedos. It was also at this time, apparently, that the coastal town of Phygela was incorporated into Ephesos.<sup class="superscript">6</sup> In 104 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> , Gaius Vibius Salutaris dedicated a series of statues at Ephesos, including one of Lysimachos. All the other statues were of divinities. This suggests that Lysimachos was considered the hero-founder of the city and that there was probably a cult devoted to him during his lifetime.<sup class="superscript">7</sup></p>
        <p>There was a royal mint at Arsinoe that produced some staters and tetradrachms, but mainly drachms.<sup class="superscript">8</sup> The city name occurs as "Arsinoe" in the literary and occasionally as "Arsinoeia" in the epigraphic evidence; on local coins it is usually abbreviated AP<span class="Symbol">S</span> I.<sup class="superscript">9</sup> The importance of the city is emphasized by the discovery there of the remains of a monumental statue of Lysimachos.<sup class="superscript">10</sup> Arsinoe was residing in the city in 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> . (Polyaenus 8.57). The city name "Arsinoe" lasted only until 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when Lysimachos was defeated by Seleukos Nikator at Korupedion. Thereafter Ephesos alternated between Seleucid and Ptolemaic control until, in 188 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , it came into Attalid hands.<sup class="superscript">11</sup> The remains of Ephesos are adjacent to the modern town of Selçuk.</p>

        <p>4. Strabo ascribes four undertakings to Lysimachos: renaming the city, rebuilding the walls, moving the population, and reconstituting the <i class="italic">gerousia</i> (14.1.21; on the question of the nature of the reconstituting, see Oliver, 13-18). <b class="bold">When the</b>

          <b class="bold">was reorganized is not clear</b> . One would assume from Strabo's narrative that all the changes happened at around the same time, and I have shown above that this was probably c. 294 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> On the other hand, an Ephesian inscription (Oliver, no. 1 = <i class="italic">Syll</i> .<sup class="superscript">3</sup> 353 = <i class="italic">I.

The latter, a general of Kassandros, captured Ephesos in 302 and held it until Demetrios retook the city the following year (Diod. 20.107 and 111). The question is whether the inscription dates to that period, when we know Prepelaos was at Ephesos (so D. van Berchem, <i class="italic">MH</i> 37 [1980] 25-27), or to the period around 294 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when, presumably, Prepelaos could have returned following the second capture of the city by Lysimachos (see further, Oliver, 18-20).

Strabo says (14.1.21) that in order to force the Ephesians to abandon their old site Lysimachos waited for a heavy rain and then blocked up the drainage channels; the subsequent flooding made the people happy to leave. (Stephanos s.v. "Ephesos" mentions the destruction caused by flooding but indicates it was a natural disaster. He also quotes an epigram [<i class="italic">Anth.

        <p>After its destruction by Alyattes in the latter part of the sixth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Smyrna was reduced, in the words of Strabo (14.1.37), to a "village-like" existence.

        <p>1. Although Strabo's claim that Smyrna existed "village-like" after its capture by the Lydians is essentially correct, the figure of four hundred years that he gives as the time span for this is too long; see Cook, 31 and n. 85. <b class="bold">For Alexander as founder</b> of Smyrna see Paus. 7.5.1; Aelius Aristides 20.7, 20, and 21.4 (ed.

Pausanias (7.5.2-3) tells the delightful story of Alexander falling asleep under a plane tree and of Nemeses appearing to him and telling him to refound the city. He also adds that the Smyrnaians thereupon sought the advice of Apollo at Klaros who answered: "Three times blest and four times will those be who will inhabit Pagos beyond the sacred Meles." H. W. Pleket recognized the words "sacred Meles" in a fragmentary inscription that probably dated to the second century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> and that was said to come from Smyrna (<i class="italic">The Greek Inscriptions in the "Rijksmuseum van Oudheden" at Leyden</i> [Leiden, 1958] 75-76, no. 62 = <i class="italic">I.

Habicht, <i class="italic">Cl. Ant</i> . 3 [1984] 46). For coins of Imperial date (Marcus Aurelius, Gordian, and Philip) showing two Nemeses appearing to the sleeping Alexander see, for example, Mionnet, 3: 231, nos. 1296-97; 250, nos. 1410-11; id., Suppl. 6: 343, no. 1707; <i class="italic">BMC Ionia</i> , 279, no. 346; 294, no. 442; <i class="italic">SNG</i> (von A) 2231; see also Leschhorn, <i class="italic"> Gründer</i> , 217-18. Cadoux (95-97) noted several possible grounds that could be alleged for treating the story relating to Alexander and Smyrna as legendary. Among other things he pointed out <i class="italic">(a)</i> the lateness of the evidence and <i class="italic">(b)</i> the fact that Strabo attributed the new foundation to Antigonos and Lysimachos, not Alexander. Nevertheless he doubted "whether these difficulties make the legendary character of the story (the existence of which has in any case to be accounted for) more probable than its substantial truthfulness" and suggested that Alexander "seriously initiated the project of a restoration, but was prevented by circumstances from executing it." Cook pointed out that the evidence of the black-glazed pottery from the uppermost level at Old Smyrna suggests that habitation there ended within Alexander's lifetime and "offers strong support to the local tradition which attributes the foundation to Alexander himself" (34). He also said that the lack of street drainage mentioned by Strabo (14.1.37) "might</p>

        <p>possibly be argued as showing that Smyrna was an earlier foundation than the new cities of the diadochs" (34 n. 103). Hence he suggests that the new city may date to 334 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> He notes correctly, however, that "default of excavation in early Hellenistic levels" at the new Smyrna makes it impossible to fix a date for the foundation (34). N. Demand speculates (<i class="italic">Urban Relocation</i> , 156-63) that, as he did at Ilion, Alexander may have suggested moving the city and made appropriate promises but left the actual work to Antigonos. There is, however, nothing to indicate whether Antigonos undertook this project while Alexander was alive. Furthermore, in the case of Antigoneia (the later Alexandreia) Troas we know that Antigonos founded it after 311 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Regarding the type of synoecism involved in the refounding of Smyrna, Kahrstedt points out (<i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Synoikismos," 1442,) it was probably that of an existing political union creating a city <i class="italic"> Zentrum</i> rather than a combining of poleis.</p>
        <p>2. Wehrli does not include Smyrna among the <b class="bold">foundations of Antigonos</b> because he considers Smyrna to have regained the status of polis by the early fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">Antig</i> . 92, following Bickerman's review of Tscherikower in <i class="italic">Gnomon</i> 4 [1928] 351-52). The evidence adduced by Bickerman and Wehrli is <i class="italic"> Syll</i> .<sup class="superscript">3</sup> 136, an Athenian inscription of 387/6 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> that mentions Smyrna (1. 19), and a silver tetradrachm that may possibly be assigned to the early fourth century (H. Weber, in <i class="italic">Corolla Numismatica</i> [Oxford, 1906] 298-99, pl. 15, no. 6; see also <i class="italic"> HN</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 591-92; K. Regling, <i class="italic"> ZfN</i> 33 [1922] 65, no. 2). But the inscription shows that by this time Smyrna was a flourishing town, not necessarily a polis. The coin, though bearing the legend </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00190.gif"></figure>
        , is <i class="italic">(a)</i> not firmly dated and <i class="italic">(b)</i> so similar to Kolophonian coins of the early fourth century that the suggestion has been made that it was a Kolophonian issue struck for the Smyrnaians (Cook, 33-34 and n. 99; cf. Cadoux, 92). Scylax (fl. mid-fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ) mentions Smyrna among the towns of the Asia Minor coast (98 [<i class="italic">GGM</i> , 1: 71]); his only comment is 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00191.gif"></figure>
        , and this hardly proves that Smyrna was a polis in the mid-fourth century! For the involvement of some Smyrnaians in the Kolophonian resistance to Lysimachos, probably c. 295/294 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , see Paus. 7-3.4 and KOLOPHON.

        <p>4. For the surviving bits of <b class="bold">the wall attributed to Lysimachos</b> see Cadoux, 102f. <i class="italic">IG</i> II<sup class="superscript">2</sup> 663 records an Athenian honorific decree of 285 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> for Artemidoros the son of Apollodoros. The inscription also mentions "King Lysimachos" (1. 18 and restored in 1. 3). A. C. Johnson (<i class="italic">AJA</i> 18 [1914] 173) suggested restoring Artemidoros' demotic in line 17 as [</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00193.gif"></figure>
        ]. Furthermore, pointing to the fact that the names Artemidoros and Apollodoros appear on Smyrnaian coins of the second century, Johnson also suggested that Artemidoros may have persuaded Lysimachos to refound Smyrna. However, Artemidoros was almost certainly a citizen of Perinthos, not Smyrna: (2. Habicht (<i class="italic">Chiron 2</i> [1972] 107-9) has called attention to a decree from Hellenistic Ephesos (<i class="italic">GIBM</i> 464) that honored an Artemidoros, a citizen of Perinthos who was the son of Apollodoros. As Habicht points out, the fact that the name, the patronymic, and the time period are the same in both inscriptions indicates we are dealing with the same person.

        <p>Kolophon was an old Greek city that had been a member of the Athenian Empire in the fifth century. A decree of the <i class="italic">demos</i> of Kolophon, dating from 311-306 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> , orders the construction of a wall to enlarge the city by</p>

        <p>enclosing both Kolophon and an abandoned site (the </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00194.gif"></figure>
        ) adjacent to Kolophon. Appended to the decree is a list of those subscribing to a loan raised for building the wall. The remains of the wall have been dated, on the basis of appearance, to the end of the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
        <sup class="superscript">1</sup> While Antigonos Monophthalmos is not specifically mentioned in connection with this project, it is quite possible, as some scholars have suggested, that he played a "behind-the-scenes" role in bringing it about. In any event, the opening lines of the decree (11. 5-6) mention that Antigonos confirmed Alexander's recognition of Kolophon's freedom.<sup class="superscript">2</sup>
        <p></p>
        <p>The decree ordering the construction of the wall is also important because it provides useful information about the mechanism for founding a city.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> Responsibility lay essentially with a ten-man commission that was charged with (1) planning the walls, (2) choosing an architect and determining his salary, (3) raising funds from outside sources (</p>

        ), (4) overseeing the placement of roads and building lots as well as the sale (or lease) of these, and (5) planning an agora and workshops as well as other public buildings. A religious ceremony, headed by a priest of Apollo together with the other priests, priestesses, the <i class="italic">prytanis</i> , the council, and the persons appointed in the decree, preceded the formal initiation of the project. From other inscriptions of this period we learn that at this time Kolophon and the port of Notion were united in a <i class="italic">sympoliteia</i> .<sup class="superscript">4</sup>
        <p></p>
        <p>After Ipsos, Kolophon fell to Lysimachos. Pausanias (1.9.7) says that Lysimachos destroyed it (and Lebedos) and transferred the population to his new foundation of Arsinoe Ephesos. In other passages he describes Kolophon as "deserted" (7.3-4) and Lebedos as "ruined" (7.3.5) as a result of Lysimachos' actions. Pausanias also says (7.3.4) that the Kolophonians (and the Smyrnaians) fought a battle against Lysimachos. Although he does not give a date for this, it is reasonable to assume that the battle came about from resistance to Lysimachos' plans; if so, it will have taken place somewhere around 294 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
          <sup class="superscript">5</sup> We do not have any further information about Kolophon until after the arrival of the Seleucids in 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Kolophon was minting coinage as early as the late sixth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and continued to mint in the Hellenistic period.<sup class="superscript">6</sup></p>

        <p>Alexander's conquest (p. 371). However, L.

Picard thought (<i class="italic">Ephèse et Claros</i> [Paris, 1922] 635) that the wall enclosed Kolophon and Notion (Kolophon by the Sea). But Robert correctly pointed out that the distance between the two sites—13 km—rendered this unlikely (<i class="italic">RPh</i> [1936] 158 n. 6). While the term <i class="italic">palaia polis</i> refers to an abandoned site near Kolophon, the expression <i class="italic">archaia polis</i> was used by the Kolophonians to describe the city itself as opposed to Kolophon by the Sea, which was another name for Notion; <i class="italic">I.

Knibbe and Magic arc quite correct that there/s evidence for the existence of Kolophon under the Seleucids, i.e., in the period after 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> : a fragmentary inscription from the city records the name of the tribe Seleuk[is] (Meritt, 380-81, no.

        <p>Ménippos," p. 66, col. III.21). Furthermore as a result of the American excavation of 1922 at Kolophon nine bronzes of Antiochos II that had been struck at Sardis were discovered (Holland, <i class="italic">Hesperia</i> 13 [1944] 143; Kinns, "Coinage of Ionia," 604-8, 617, nos. 127-35). There is also evidence for an Antiocheia festival at Kolophon (P. Frisch, <i class="italic">ZPE</i> 13 [1974] 112-16 and 15 [1974] 98). Finally, at some point in the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , Kolophon received an embassy from Priene (<i class="italic">I. Priene</i> 57). As for Lebedos, its representatives appear in a decree of Ionian cities in honor of Antiochos I (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 222.47 = <i class="italic">I. Erythrai u. Klazomenai</i> 504). On the other hand, at Kolophon the American excavation did find evidence for destruction and/or desertion at the end of the fourth century (Holland, 169; Kinns, "Coinage of Ionia," 305-6; unfortunately the expedition could not continue beyond 1922 because of the unsettled conditions at the time). The fact that both cities existed later in the third century says nothing about the nature or extent of Lysimachos' actions against them. It is, after all, quite conceivable that, as Pausanias says, Lysimachos <i class="italic">did</i> destroy and depopulate them and that they were later refounded. Of course the "destruction" of a city could take a number of forms: the physical destruction of the acropolis or buildings in the city, the demolition of parts or all of its walls, or the deprivation of its rights as an independent, corporate body, i.e., the reduction of it to the status of a village; see L. Robert, <i class="italic">Gnomon</i> 42 (1970) 597-98. Pausanias' narrative (and the archaeological evidence in the case of Kolophon) suggests the destruction of Kolophon and Lebedos was of the former variety and that it involved a general depopulation.</p>
        <p>The decree for Meinippos noted above twice mentions the existence of a Prepelaion (J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">Claros</i> , pp. 63-64, col. I.23, 36). This has prompted the Roberts to suggest that after Ipsos Kassandros' general, Prepelaos, entered into the service of his ally, Lysimachos (on Prepelaos see Olshausen, <i class="italic"> Prosopographie</i> , 9-11 n. 4, and ARSINOE Ephesos). They further suggest that in this capacity Prepelaos intervened with the king in order to rebuild Kolophon after its recent destruction (<i class="italic">Claros</i> , 77-84). This is, of course, only a hypothesis. However, it does explain the existence of the Prepelaion, a sanctuary that probably held the tomb of Prepelaos and could have been consecrated to him as the new founder of Kolophon; cf. PYRRHEION.</p>
        <p>Pausanias says (7.3.4) that the graves of the Kolophonians and Smyrnaians who died fighting Lysimachos were on the side of the road to Klaros. In fact two tombs on this road have been discovered (Schuchhardt, <i class="italic">AM</i> 11 [1886] 414-15). Schuchhardt suggested these were graves of men killed in Lysimachos' operations in the area in 302 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> If so, they would not likely be the tombs of Kolophonians, since at that time, according to Diod. 20.107.5, Kolophon did not resist Kassandros' general, Prepelaos; see Magie, <i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 916, 920-21.</p>

Among other things, he dedicated the temple of Athena Polias and granted freedom and autonomy to the Prienians in the port city of Naulochon. The Prienians reciprocated this beneficence: the existence of an Alexandreion in the second half of the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> indicates that at the time there was a cult of Alexander in Priene.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> The new Priene was located near the modern Güllübahçe.</p>
        <p>1. <b class="bold">There is no direct evidence to support the contention that Alexander refounded Priene</b> . Rather it is a hypothesis based on the lack of evidence, literary or epigraphic, for the city in the period c. 390 to c. 350 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Furthermore the excavators T. Wiegand and H. Schrader found nothing at the refounded site they believed could be dated to the pre-Hellenistic period (<i class="italic">Priene</i> [Berlin, 1904] 35, 45); see also Habicht, <i class="italic">Gott</i> .<sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 18 n. 9; D. van Berchem, <i class="italic">MH</i> 27 (1970) 198-205; both Habicht and van Berchem cite a Munich dissertation by A.

While the hypothesis regarding the relocation has won nearly universal support (see, for example, Bean, op. cit.; Hornblower, <i class="italic">Mausolus</i> [Oxford, 1982] 323ff.; contra, see Demand, below), the question of whether this was the work of the Hekatomnids or Alexander remains open.</p>
        <p>In a recent study Hornblower has noted (<i class="italic">Mausolus</i> , 323-30) among other things that <i class="italic">(a)</i> in an Argive <i class="italic"> theorodokoi</i> list of the 330s of Ionian cities (P.

        , the normal abbreviation on Naulochan coinage of this period (K. Regling, <i class="italic">Die Münzen von Priene</i> [Berlin, 1927] 47, no. 47); see also van Berchem, 200-201. Hornblower argues that both phenomena can be explained if we assume that between the 390s and the 330s Priene effectively did not exist and was replaced by Naulochon, its harbor city. But this argument is <i class="italic">ex silentio</i> , as Hornblower admits (327; cf. S. Sherwin-White, <i class="italic">JHS</i> 105 [1985] 88-89). Hornblower also brings positive considerations in favor of Alexander (328): <i class="italic">(a)</i> he may have refounded Smyrna and Alinda, so a refoundation of Priene would not be implausible; <i class="italic">(b)</i> his special interest in Priene is clear from

        <p>his dedication of the Athena Polias temple (<i class="italic">I. Priene</i> 156 = A.J. Heisserer, <i class="italic">Alexander the Great and the Greeks</i> [Norman, Okla., 1980] 143). There was a local tradition at Smyrna for Alexander as founder, but it is all late (see Cadoux, <i class="italic"> Ancient Smyrna</i> , 95-97; and EURYDIKEIA Smyrna). In fact, Strabo ascribes the founding of (Eurydikeia) Smyrna to Antigonos Monophthalmos and Lysimachos (14.1.37). As for Alinda, its refounding as an Alexandreia, while likely, is not definite, nor is the founder known (see ALEXANDREIA by Latmos). Suggestions also include the Carian queen Ada, Lysimachos, and Anfigonos Monophthalmos. In any event it is well to recall that there is no settlement in Asia Minor that can unequivocally be ascribed to Alexander; see further, Appendix II. With regard to <b class="bold">the date of the Athena temple</b> , J. C. Carter originally suggested that construction began in the mid-fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and that Alexander merely completed it (<i class="italic">The Sculpture of the Sanctuary of Athena Polias at Priene</i> [London, 1983] 25-31; see also P. Hellström and T. Thieme, <i class="italic">Labraunda</i> I.3: The <i class="italic">Temple of Zeus</i> [Stockholm, 1982] 45-56, who, on the basis of similarities between the Mausoleum at Halikarnassos, the temple of Zeus at Labraunda, and the Athena temple at Priene, likewise suggested that the latter dated to the mid-fourth century). In 1988, relying especially on C. V. Crowther's down-dating of <i class="italic">I. Priene</i> 3 (decree in honor of Megabyzos) from c. 334/3 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> to the 290s, he suggested the temple "was completed after a pause of fifty years in the 290's" (<i class="italic">Akten des XIII. internationalen Kongresses Jür klassische Archäologie, Berlin</i> 1988 [Mainz, 1990] 133-34).</p>
        <p>A date in the mid-fourth century for the relocation has also been suggested. Thus, Hiller von Gaertringen suggested it was Athens that supported the refounding, soon after Mausolos' death (<i class="italic">I. Priene</i> , XI, 10 [commentary on no. 5.19], and 204), while Bean and Cook thought it was the Hekatomnids (<i class="italic">ABSA</i> 52 [1957] 141). Finally N. Demand has argued against relocation, i.e., that the city had never ceased to exist (<i class="italic">Phoenix</i> 40 [1986] 35-44 and <i class="italic">Urban Relocation</i> , 140-46).</p>

        <p>Lebedos attracted the attention of a number of Hellenistic rulers. At the end of the fourth century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> (probably between 306 and 302 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ) Antigonos wanted to transfer its inhabitants to Teos in an attempt to unite the two cities. In the process Lebedian homes were to be razed. The plan was not completed. Later on (c. 290 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ) Lysimachos transferred Lebedians and Kolophonians to Arsinoe, his refoundation of Ephesos.<sup class="superscript">1</sup></p>

        <p>A Ptolemais in Ionia and its identification with Lebedos are nowhere attested in the literary evidence. The earliest indication of its existence was numismatic. Waddington assigned coins of Ptolemais to Lebedos, though he did not give his reasons for so doing. In 1902 Dieudonné showed conclusively that certain coins with the legend <span class="Symbol">P</span> TO may be ascribed to Lebedos.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> Dieudonné was apparently unaware of the publication in 1900 of <i class="italic">I. Mag</i> . 53, a Magnesian inscription of the late third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> that mentioned "Ptolemaians who were previously called Lebedians" (ll. 79-81). Then in 1946 L. Robert published a fragment of a Delphic <i class="italic"> theorodokoi</i> list that probably dates to between 230-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and records a Ptolemais between Ephesos and Teos.<sup class="superscript">3</sup></p>
        <p>There is at present no extant evidence to pinpoint when the name Ptolemais was first imposed. Furthermore we do not know when the Ptolemies first got control of Lebedos nor if possession was continuous until the end of the third century. The city joined other Ionian towns in honoring Antiochos I in 266 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> or soon after that (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 222). And inasmuch as Ptolemy II Philadelphos lost control of Ionia during the Second Syrian War, it is probable that Ptolemy III Euergetes I, who reconquered southern Ionia during the Third Syrian War, was the founder rather than his father. If this is correct, then it is likely that the portraits of the king and queen on coins of Ptolemais are those of Ptolemy III and Berenike II rather than of Philadelphos and Arsinoe II. The discovery at Lebedos of a fragment of an inscription that names Ptolemy III Euergetes and Berenike II lends support to the claim that he founded Ptolemais. Presumably the name change did not last beyond 197 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when Antiochos III captured Ephesos (<i class="italic">FGrH</i> 260 F46). In any event an inscription discovered in the Heraion at Samos and dated to the early second century records a decree of "the Lebedians."<sup class="superscript">4</sup></p>
        <p>Lebedos was located near the village of Urkmez on the Kisik (formerly Xingi) peninsula, thirty-six kilometers northwest of Ephesos.<sup class="superscript">5</sup></p>

Pausanias says that in the process of transferring people to ARSINOE Ephesos Lysimachos "destroyed" Lebedos and Kolophon (1.9.7). In another passage (7.3.5) he describes Lebedos as "ruined" following Lysimachos' actions. The likelihood is that the transfer involved most, if not all, of the population. On the "<b class="bold">destruction</b> " of a city and the various forms this could take see KOLOPHON.

Dieudonné's identification was based, in the main, on two arguments: Korabos, one of the magistrates whose name appears on coins of Ptolemais, is also found on those of Hellenistic Lebedos (cf., for example, <i class="italic">SAG</i> [von A] 2027 and <i class="italic">Inv. Wadd</i> . 1711; Dieudonné's claim [54] that the name Korabos is found only at Lebedos is no longer correct; see L. Robert, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 106 [1982] 324). And Athena, who is frequently represented on Lebedian coins, often appears on the coinage of Ptolemais (<i class="italic">JIAN</i> 5 [1902] 53-57). It is necessary to distinguish between <i class="italic">(a)</i> coins with <span class="Symbol"> P</span> TO<span class="Symbol">L</span> EMAIE<span class="Symbol">W</span> N, <span class="Symbol">P</span> TO<span class="Symbol">L</span> EMAI, or <span class="Symbol">P</span> TO<span class="Symbol">L</span> E without a magistrate's name but with an amphora (and, occasionally, a bird) and <i class="italic">(b)</i> coins with the abbreviation <span class="Symbol">P</span> TO, a magistrate's name, and a portrait of a king or queen.

        . He admitted the difficulty caused by his proposed restoration in that Lebedos was known as Ptolemais at the time of the inscription and Ptolemais was actually named in the list. To resolve the problem he suggested a number of solutions: <i class="italic">(a)</i> there was an error in compiling the list (Daux rejected this possibility), <i class="italic">(b)</i> the list dates to before the refounding, <i class="italic">(c)</i> Lebedos was never renamed (and, hence, the Ptolemais of line 11 was some town other than Lebedos); Ptolemais was a foundation populated by former Lebedians but distinct from Lebedos, which continued to exist as a separate city. Daux's restoration creates more difficulties than it solves; it is not convincing. Robert restored l. 17:

Herrmann, <i class="italic"> Anadolu</i> 9 (1965) 114 n. 141. Svoronos believed Philadelphos was the founder of Ptolemais (<i class="italic">JLAN</i> 5 [1902] 68). He suggested that most of the portraits on the bronzes of Ptolemais are of Philadelphos and Arsinoe (68-69; though Svoronos did believe that one tetradrachm at least had Euergetes on it [69]; see also <i class="italic"> HN</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> 580; <i class="italic">SNG</i> [Cop] <i class="italic"> Ionia</i> 788-89). This identification has been generally—and correctly—rejected in favor of Ptolemy III Euergetes I and Berenike II. Kinns ("Coinage of Ionia," 253-55), for example, pointed out that a coin of Marathos in Phoenicia that served as part of the basis for Svoronos's identification (<i class="italic">JIAN</i> 5 [1902] 67) was misdated by him. The coin in question is dated 34. Svoronos took this to be based on a Ptolemaic (<i class="italic">sic</i> ) era beginning in 312/311 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Thus he dated the coin to 279/8 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and identified the queen as Arsinoe II. However, Seyrig has demonstrated that the era on the coins of Marathos is the same as that in use at Arados, which began in 260/59 (<i class="italic">RN</i> [1964] 45-47); thus the coin is to be dated to 227/6. Furthermore, Kinns notes that the portrait cannot be a posthumous one of Arsinoe II because the tokens of her deification, the scepter behind the head and the horn at the ear, are lacking. For the identification of the king and queen as Ptolemy III and Berenike II see, in addition to Kinns, Dieudonné (<i class="italic">JLAN</i> 5 [1902] 58-60), Imhoof-Blumer (<i class="italic">Gr.

        , and hence that the soldiers came from the coastal region of Ionia and Caria and were on their way back to Thrace (LW III. 1766 and pp. 259-60). Writing in 1907 Radet hypothesized that Paraleia was really Parableia near Mugla in southeast Carla (<i class="italic">Rev. Hist</i> . 95 [1907] 154). Earlier, in 1897, Radet had suggested that the soldiers were from Pakaleia, the plain east of Amorion in Phrygia (<i class="italic">La Lydie</i> , 35 n. 3). However, the name of this plain was Pankaleia, not Pakaleia, and it is known only from the Byzantine period (Ramsay, <i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 231; L. Robert, <i class="italic">VAM</i>
        <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 77 n. 6).

        <p>We can trace three names for the city known to us in the Hellenistic period as Apollonia: Apollonia, Antoniopolis, and Tripolis. Unlike the later names for the town, there is no literary evidence for the name Apollonia. In fact its earlier existence as an Apollonia was suggested for the first time in 1896 by Imhoof-Blumer. His evidence was numismatic.

        .<sup class="superscript">1</sup> This inscription proves the existence of a city by that name; it does not, however, prove the identification of Apollonia on the Maeander with Tripolis. Nevertheless the identification is highly plausible and may be accepted. It can also be assumed that a coin with the ethnic A<span class="Symbol">P</span> O<span class="Symbol">LLW</span> NIAT<span class="Symbol">W</span> N and the Maeander symbol should be attributed to Apollonia on the Maeander rather than some other like-named city.<sup class="superscript">2</sup>
        <p></p>
        <p>There is no explicit evidence to indicate that Apollonia on the Maeander was an Attalid foundation.

Furthermore, the presence of Ionicisms in the decree suggests Apollonia may have been an old Ionian city rather than a Hellenistic foundation.<sup class="superscript">4</sup></p>
        <p>Apollonia adopted the name Antoniopolis in honor of the triumvir Marcus Antonius possibly as early as 41 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> , when Antony was in Asia Minor. After the overthrow of Antony the city took the name Tripolis.<sup class="superscript">5</sup></p>

They point out that there is a confusion between the city names Apollonis and Apollonia. The former, they suggest, was in honor of the wife of Attalos I; the latter, for the god Apollo. With specific regard to Apollonia on the Maeander, they claim that <i class="italic">I. Milet</i> 74.2-3 shows the city existed prior to the period of Attalid domination in the area.</p>
        <p>The Roberts base the latter argument on the dating of <i class="italic">I. Milet</i> 74 to c. 200 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> This dating, however, is tentative. The Roberts' doubts about an Attalid origin for Apollonia on the Maeander were reinforced by the attribution of the Apollonia decree to Apollonia on the Maeander (see below, note 4).</p>

        <p>According to Stephanos (s.v. "Attaleia") Attaleia was originally called Agroeira or Alloeira. It is generally agreed that this Attaleia, which Stephanos and other Byzantine authors place in Lydia,<sup class="superscript">1</sup> is the same town as that mentioned in the agreement made between Eumenes I and some soldiers stationed in Attaleia. It is not clear, however, whether Eumenes or his predecessor, Philetairos, founded Attaleia.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> We know nothing about the civic organization of Attaleia in Hellenistic times; the soldiers mentioned in the Attaleia agreement were organized under a commanding officer and <i class="italic">hegemones</i> . Under the Roman Empire the city had a <i class="italic">boule</i> and <i class="italic">demos</i> that regularly passed decrees.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> The extant coinage dates only from the second and third centuries <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span>

        <p>1 The new <i class="italic">conventus</i> list from Sardis (C. Habicht, <i class="italic"> JRS</i> 65 [1975] 65, II.7, late first century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> ) includes Attaleia under Pergamon, as does Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.126). However at sec. 121 Pliny mentions a number of Aeolian cities inland from Kyme and Myrina, among them a certain Itale. A possible emendation has "Attalia"; see the Teubner Pliny (ed. C. Mayhoff [1906; reprint, Stuttgart, 1967]). Hierokles (670.5) and the <i class="italic">Not. Ep</i> . (1160, etc.), as well as Stephanos, place it in Lydia. Attaleia in Lydia should be distinguished from Attalia on the coast of Mysia opposite Lesbos, which is recorded on the <i class="italic">Tab. Peut</i> . (VIII.4) and which is probably to be identified with Attea of the same region mentioned by Strabo (13. 1.51; on the complex problem of identifying, locating, and distinguishing this Attea and the one that issued coinage in the second and third centuries <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span> see H. von Fritze, <i class="italic">Ant.

They speculated that Eumenes founded it after his victory over Antiochos I at Sardis and named it for his grandfather, i.e., Philetairos' father. Allen (<i class="italic">Attalid Kingdom</i> , 24, and <i class="italic">ABSA</i> 66 [1971] 3 and n. 12) suggested that Attaleia was completed <i class="italic"> before</i> the battle of Sardis and, hence, that it was founded by</p>

        <sup class="superscript">2</sup> 648; see also ATTALEIA in Aetolia). Pliny, however, has "Attalenses" (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.126) just as he writes "Panteenses" for "Pantheotae" (see Habicht, <i class="italic">JRS</i> 65 [1975] 80).
        <p></p>
        <p>5. In the course of the last century and a half conjectures about the <b class="bold">location</b> of Attaleia have moved progressively northward. Hamilton believed it was at the site of the present Adala, basing his suggestion on the homonymous names (<i class="italic">Researches</i> , 1: 43; against this see Radet, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 11 [1887] 170; Robert, <i class="italic">VAM</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 100-102). Fontrier, relying on an incorrect restoration of an inscription found at Mermere (between Sardis and Thyateira), placed the town there (<i class="italic">Mous. k. Bibl</i> . 5 [1886] 48f.; contra, Radet, <i class="italic">BCH</i> [1887] 170-75, 397-98). With the discovery of a decree of Attaleia north of Thyateira Radet was able to suggest that the location was at Gördük Kale (<i class="italic">BCH</i> [1887] 173-75). Further investigation by Keil and von Premerstein (KP II, pp. 60-61) suggested that the site was at Yaran Tepe, a quarter hour south-southwest of Selçikli, while Schuchhardt (<i class="italic">Alt. v. Perg</i> . I.1: 140, followed by C. Foss, <i class="italic">AS</i> 37 [1987] 95) suggested a site called Karaman Mezar (now called Koca Mezarlik) southeast of Selçikli. On the location see further Robert, <i class="italic">RA</i> (1934) 90-91; Virgilio, <i class="italic">SCO</i> (1982) 115-19; Herrmann, <i class="italic">TAM</i> V.2, p. 296 (map at end); Foss, 94-99 (map on p. 82).</p>
        <p>Attaleia, at the eastern extremity of Eumenes' empire, was located in the fertile upper Lykos Valley (on the identification of the Lykos see L. Robert, <i class="italic">Ét. anat</i> ., 187 and n. 2). Fertility of the soil was undoubtedly an important factor in choosing the location, as L. Robert has argued (<i class="italic">RA</i> [1934:] 90-92). However, despite the lack of strategic value of the site itself (Robert, 90-92), one should not overlook the proximity of the site to the Seleucid Thyateira, 13 km to the south (see Ramsay, <i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 44 n.; Hansen, <i class="italic">Attalids</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 22; also Virgilio, 116-19). Despite their being founded by opposing monarchies the two cities had similar coin types in the second and third centuries <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> (Head, <i class="italic">BMC Lydia</i> , xxxvii).</p>

        <p>1. Schulten thought Seleukos I was the <b class="bold">founder</b> of Doidye (<i class="italic">Hermes</i> 32 [1897] 529); Hansen suggested it was Antiochos I (<i class="italic">Attalids</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 174). For the probability that the Macedonian colony at Doidye was Seleucid in origin see the discussion on NAKRASON. For the possibility that the name Doidye may have originated in the European home of the original Macedonian settlers see Schuchhardt, <i class="italic">AM</i> 13 (1888) 16; but cf. Bürchner (<i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Doidye"), who thought the name might be Carian. See also APOLLONIS and -ESPOURA. At one time Schuchhardt thought that Doidye was the original name of Apollonis and that the latter supplanted it (<i class="italic">AM</i> [1888] 15-17, followed by Ramsay, <i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 126). The principal objection raised against this hypothesis was that cistophori of Apollonis were dated to around 186 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> , while the date of the Doidye inscription (161/0 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ) indicated that Doidye coexisted with Apollonis (Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">Lyd. Stadt</i> ., 26). In fact Robinson has since demonstrated conclusively that the cistophori of Apollonis should be dated to the third and fourth years of Aristonikos (<i class="italic">NC</i> [1954] 1-8). The founding date of Apollonis is not definitely known; most probably it was established between 183 and 159 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> See APOLLONIS. Schuchhardt later changed his view and suggested that Doidye was a smaller fortress approximately 500 meters north of Apollonis (<i class="italic">AM</i> 24 [1899] 154-56, see map on p. 155; id., in <i class="italic">Alt. v. Perg</i> . I.1: 141-43, followed by Hansen, <i class="italic">Attalids</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 176).</p>
        <p>2. Suggestions for the <b class="bold">location</b> of Doidye include Dereköy, approximately 2 km north (Radet, <i class="italic">De Coloniis</i> , 17), and Jajaköy, 7 km north of Apollonis (Radet, <i class="italic">La Lydie</i> , map; von Diest, <i class="italic">Von Perg</i> ., 22; Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">Lyd. Stadt</i> ., 26). In any event the fact that the inscription was discovered at Palamut, which is very close to the site of the ancient Apollonis, suggests that Doidye may have been in its territory (see KP I, p. 45; L.

        <p>Eumeneia in Hyrkania is mentioned only by Stephanos, who gives the name and no further information. No other extant source refers to it. Droysen suggested it was located in Hyrkania (which was south of the Caspian Sea) and that its founder was Eumenes of Cardia. Tscherikower, however, rightly objected that Eumenes had neither the time nor the means to found a colony. He conjectured that it was located in the Hyrkanian plain of Lydia.

        <p>Around the end of the third century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> (probably between 212 and 205 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ) Antiochos III sent two thousand Babylonian Jews and their families to settle in the "garrisons and most important places" of Lydia and Phrygia. Our only source of information for this colonization is Josephus, who records the letter sent by the king to Zeuxis ordering the establishment of these settlements (<i class="italic">AJ</i> 12.148-53). As the letter provides a detailed account of how a colony was founded, I quote it in full.</p>
        <q class="blockquote">
          <p>King Antiochos to Zeuxis, his father, greetings. If you are in good health, it is well. I am also in good health. It is necessary to give my very serious consideration to a revolt that I learn has broken out among the inhabitants of Lydia and Phrygia; and having consulted with my friends as to what should be done, I have decided to convey two thousand Jewish families with their effects from Mesopotamia and Babylonia to the garrisons and most important places. For I believe that because of their piety toward the Deity they will be loyal protectors of our interests; and I know that they are a people whose character was approved by my ancestors, both in regard to their trustworthiness and to their willingness to do what was asked of them. I wish, therefore, even if it is difficult, to move them, and since I promised, (I want them) to live under their own laws. When you have brought them to the aforementioned places, you will give to each of them a place for building a home as well as land for farming and for viticulture and you will grant a tax exemption often years on the produce of the earth. Until such time as they get harvests from the earth let there be measured out to them grain for their attendants. Let enough be given to those doing military service so that by receiving concessions from us they will show themselves all the more zealous to our cause. And take care of their people, as much as you can, so that they are not bothered by anyone.</p>
        </q>
        <p>Other than to say the colonies were set up in Lydia and Phrygia Josephus says nothing about the precise location of any of them.</p>
        <p>The scholarship on the letter of Antiochos III to Zeuxis is extensive and has been primarily concerned with the question of its authenticity; see, for example, the discussion and bibliography of R. Marcus in the Loeb Josephus, vol. 7, pp. 743-44, 764-66. To his bibliography add the following, who generally accept</p>

        <p>Whether or not it is authentic, the letter remains a valuable source of information for the procedure followed in establishing a colony. For analysis and discussion see Schalit and Gauger, cited above, and Cohen, <i class="italic">Seleucid Colonies</i> , 5-9. On the Jewish prowess in military affairs during the Hellenistic period, see Josephus (<i class="italic">AJ</i> 12.119), who comments on the military service the Jews provided the Seleucid kings, and Seleukos Nikator's use of them as colonists; see also Schalit, 297-98; Cohen, <i class="italic">TAPA</i> 103 (1972) 84 n. 5.</p>
        <p>Josephus nowhere specifies which were "<b class="bold">the garrisons and most important places.</b> " New inscriptional evidence suggests that after the overthrow of Achaios in 214 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> , Antiochos III partly destroyed Sardis and then permitted a new <i class="italic">synoikismos</i> . G. M. A. Hanfmann and J. C. Waldbaum have speculated that SARDIS was one of the "important places" to which the Jews were sent (<i class="italic">Essays in Honor of Nelson Glueck</i> , ed. J. A. Saunders [Garden City, N.Y., 1970] 319). This is not likely; see further, SARDIS. For the inscriptions relating to the synoecism, see Gauthier, <i class="italic">Sardes</i> II: nos. 1 and 3.</p>

        <p>In the past it has been claimed that Kadoi was a Macedonian colony.

However, in other references the name of the town is simply Kadoi, (or, on coins, the ethnic is KA<span class="Symbol">D</span> OHN<span class="Symbol">W</span> N) without any addition.

Robert, <i class="italic"> Hellenica</i> 6 [1948] 22-23; AGATHEIRA, -ESPOURA, KOBEDYLE, DOIDYE) Herrmann quite reasonably suggested that the Lasnedda settlers were also Macedonians (p. 44). Herrmann also conjectured that Lasnedda was in the territory of Hyrkanis (p. 43; see also J. and L. Robert <i class="italic">BE</i> (1970) 516). If this suggestion is correct, it would mean that the Macedonian Hyrkanians controlled the mountainous region to the southeast as well as part of the Hyrkanian plain. However, it should be emphasized that the Lasnedda inscription provides firm evidence only for the geographical, not necessarily for the political, proximity of the two colonies. We do not know when, if ever, the colony of Lasnedda was incorporated in the territory of HYRKANIS (cf. THYATEIRA and MERNOUPHYTA). For another colony close to Hyrkanis see AGATHEIRA. The appearance of the god Papias in Lydia is surprising. Up until the discovery of the Lasnedda inscription Papias was known only in Phrygia (Herrmann and Polatkan, 45).

        <p>The case of Magnesia near Sipylos is interesting because it provides us with an example of military colonists who were settled in an old Greek city. We learn about the colony from an inscription (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 229) that records three documents of c. 243 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> : (I) a decree of Smyrna concerning a treaty with Magnesia (ll. 1-34), (II) a treaty between the two cities (ll. 34-89), and (III) a decree of Smyrna concerning Palaimagnesia (ll. 89-108).<sup class="superscript">1</sup> The documents deal with the granting of citizenship by Smyrna to the Magnesians and Palaimagnesians.</p>
        <p>According to document II the population of Magnesia consisted of three groups, (I) soldiers in Magnesia, (2) those out in the open, and (3) native Magnesians: </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00275.gif"></figure>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00276.gif"></figure>
         The precise distinction between the first two groups has been the subject of much discussion. Among other things, scholars disagree as to whether the term <i class="italic">katoikoi</i> refers only to the soldiers in Magnesia or to the soldiers out in the open as well. While no definitive answer can be given, it seems more likely that it includes all the soldiers.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> The organization of the <i class="italic">katoikoi</i> was essentially military. They were divided into <i class="italic">tagmata</i> , and each <i class="italic">tagma</i> had a secretary. There were also muster rolls for each group. Furthermore, at least some of the <i class="italic">katoikoi</i> had land lots.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> We do not know whether those in the city lived in their homes, in barracks, or were billeted. Presumably those out in the open were bivouacked near Magnesia. The <i class="italic">katoikoi</i> —and not the Magnesians—had the real power in the city: in the dealings with Smyrna it was the <i class="italic">katoikoi</i> who handled most of the negotiations. With the signing of the treaty the whole population of Magnesia became citizens of Smyrna.<sup class="superscript">4</sup>
        <p></p>
        <p>It is possible that Antiochos I founded the colony at Magnesia.<sup class="superscript">5</sup> Magnesia, the present Manisa, was approximately thirty-two kilometers northeast of Smyrna.</p>

        <p>The inscription recording the <i class="italic">conventus</i> list of the Flavian province of Asia begins with the following names: "Makedones, Ankyranoi, Synaeitai, Mokadenoi, Kadyeneis ..." By comparison with the list that Pliny gives of the cities in the Sardian <i class="italic">conventus</i> (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.111: <i class="italic">Macedones, Cadieni, Philadelphini</i> ...) Habicht has shown that the first part of the inscription deals with the <i class="italic">conventus</i> of Sardis. The first name on the inscription undoubtedly refers to the descendants of Macedonian colonists who were settled at some time in the Hellenistic period, and certainly is to be identified with the Macedonians recorded by Pliny. While the location of the settlement is not definitely known, the order in the inscription does show a general eastward progression. This suggests that the foundation was west of Ankyra, either on the Makestos (Simav) River or dose to it. Therefore it is possible, as Habicht has conjectured, that the Macedonians were located on the western shore of Lake Simav at the site of the present Kiliseköy.</p>

For the separation of Macedones and Cadieni in the text of Pliny see Habicht, 72-73; and KADOI. Regarding the location of the places mentioned after Makedones: Kadoi was quite close to the modern Gediz (Buresch, <i class="italic">Aus Lydien</i> , 155-58; see also Ruge, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Phrygia," 794, 833). The region Mokadene included Temenothyrai, Silandos, and the territory north of these cities (Habicht, 72). Synaos was on the site of Simav, just southeast of the lake of the same name (Buresch, <i class="italic">Aus Lydien</i> , 142—43; L. Robert <i class="italic">VAM</i>
          <sup class="superscript"> 2</sup> , 95 n. 2; but cf. Drew-Bear, <i class="italic">Chiron</i> 6 [1976] 291 n. 7). The location of Ankyra is not definitely known. Buresch thought it was at Kiliseköy (<i class="italic">Aus Lydien</i> , 142). Waddington suggested it was northeast of the lake at Hasanlar (LW III. 1011, commentary). In this he was followed by L. Robert (<i class="italic">Gnomon</i> 31 [1959] 19 n. 5); and by Habicht (72). The connection of Ankyra with Hasanlar leaves Kiliseköy open for another possible identification. On this basis Habicht suggested it is the site of the colony of the Makedones.</p>

         (KP II.51 = <i class="italic"> TAM</i> V.2.959). This is the only extant evidence for a colony at Mernouphyta. From the inscription we learn <i class="italic">(a)</i> that the colony at Mernouphyta was Attalid, founded by Attalos I and reinforced by Eumenes II,<sup class="superscript">1</sup> and <i class="italic"> (b)</i> that the worship of Herakles figured prominently in the life of the colonists and their descendants. The worship of Herakles is not surprising. He was the ancestral god of the Attalids, and in addition he was the patron god of gymnasia.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> The discovery of the inscription at Thyateira (Akhisar) suggests that Mernouphyta was located close by; precisely where we do not know. Nor do we know when the colony was founded. At the very least it is clear that the Attalids established a colony at Mernouphyta with an eye to Thyateira, either to counter it, if it was still Seleucid, or to control it, if it had come under Attalid rule.

        <p>that the problem is complicated by the fact that we do not know exactly when and for how long before 189 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> the Attalids controlled the region around Thyateira. Prior to c. 226 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> it was Seleucid. From c. 226 to 223 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Attalos I was master of the area (Will, <i class="italic">Hist</i> .<sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 1: 296ff.). After losing it in 223 he regained it in 218 (Holleaux, <i class="italic">Ét</i> ., 2: 17f.; Meyer, <i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 105); he had control of it in 201 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> when Philip marched on it (Polyb. 16.1.7). While it is not certain if the area remained under Pergamene rule long after 201, it is dear that in 190 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> the territory <i class="italic">circa Thyatiram</i> was under Seleucid control (Livy 37.8.7, 37.6, 38.1). After the treaty of Apameia it passed permanently to the Attalids.

        <p>Ptolemy in fact places the Mysomakedones in Mysia (5.2.13). However, a city in the <i class="italic">conventus</i> of Ephesos could not be located that far away. In any event the inscription from Antioch resolves the question in support of Pliny.</p>

        <p>3. For the likelihood that the Macedonian colonists in western Asia Minor were settled by the Seleucids rather than the Attalids see NAKRASON. Whereas the available evidence indicates that Macedonians are rarely found in the Attalid army (see NAKRASON), there is evidence for Mysians under Attalos I (<i class="italic">FD</i> II.1, p. 224) and Eumenes II (Livy 42.57.7); note also that Mysians and Macedonians received citizenship after the death of Attalos III (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 338.14). Hence it is possible that the Mysians of the Mysomakedones were introduced by the Attalids rather than the Seleucids. Launey (<i class="italic">Recherhes</i> , 444), Keil, and Ramsay thought it was a Seleucid colony; Hansen and Magie suggested it was Attalid.</p>
        <p>4. The precise <b class="bold">location</b> of the settlement of the Mysomakedones is not yet known. Pliny's list of cities in the <i class="italic"> conventus</i> of Ephesos includes the <i class="italic">Cilbiani inferiores et superiores, Mysomacedones, Mastaurenses, Briullitae, Hypaepeni, Dioshieritae</i> . Ramsay thought the settlement of the Mysomakedones was southeast of Philadelpheia in the Üzüm Ovasi (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 196). Radet thought it was at Bulladan (<i class="italic">La Lydie</i> , 315, and <i class="italic">De Colonüs</i> , 28-29). However, Keil and von Premerstein correctly pointed out that since the Mysomakedones were in the <i class="italic">conventus</i> of Ephesos, the colony was probably farther west (KP III, p. 58; Keil, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Mysomakedones"). Buresch suggested it was in the eastern Mesogis (<i class="italic">Aus Lydien</i> , 180, and <i class="italic">AM</i> 19 [1894] 123ff.; see also Tscherikower, 26). L. Robert would likewise locate it in the eastern part of the Mesogis range (<i class="italic">ATAM</i> , 336-37, n. 72; though note that earlier, in <i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 11-12</p>

          ). Pliny's list does allow our locating the settlement in the eastern Mesogis. In the absence of additional information, however, we can do no more than posit a location in that general area. For a map see KP III, end.</p>

        <p>In his enumeration of the communities of the <i class="italic">conventus</i> of Sardis Pliny mentions the "Mysotimolitae" after the Apollonihieritae (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5-111). It is possible that the Mysotimolitae originated as a colony in which Mysian veterans were combined with natives in the area of Mount Tmolos. The precise location of Mysotimolos cannot be fixed. However, the fact that in the Flavian <i class="italic">conventus</i> list it precedes Blaundos suggests that the two may have been neighboring cities. Most likely Mysotimolos was in the region between Blaundos and the upper Kogamos River.</p>
        <p><b class="bold">In general</b> see KP III, pp. 48-50; Buresch, <i class="italic">Aus Lydien</i> , 201-4; Ramsay, <i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 127-128; Keil, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Mysotimolos"; C. Foss, <i class="italic">Cl. Ant</i> . 1 (1982) 178-201.</p>
        <p>For the suggestion that Mysotimolos was originally a military colony see Magie, <i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 974, who cites the parallel example of the MYSOMAKEDONES. On the Mysians see Magie, 974; <i class="italic">OGIS</i> 338.14. On the <b class="bold">location</b> of Mysotimolos see Strabo 13.4.5 (Lydians, Mysians, and Macedonians living near Mount Tmolos; cf.

Gelzer [Leipzig, 1890]). For the <i class="italic"> conventus</i> list see Habicht, <i class="italic">JRS</i> 65 (1975) 65, col. I.26. Hierokles includes Mysotimolos in Lydia (671.3). Habicht (76) follows Buresch (201, 204) in suggesting the region between Giüllü and Güney. Keil and von Premerstein thought it was in the area of Takmak (now Cirpiclar), perhaps at Beysehir<a name="d0e17927-ref" href="#d0e17927" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          (KP III, pp. 48-51; Keil, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Lydia," 2194-95, and s.v. "Mysotimolos"; and Ramsay, <i class="italic"> HGAM</i> , 128). On the other hand, Radet thought k was west of Güney (<i class="italic">La Lydie</i> , 315); Jones believed k was in the same general area, i.e., south of the Kogamos on the slopes of Mount Tmolos (<i class="italic">CERP</i>

        <p></p>
        <p>3. Nakrason is one of a number of <b class="bold">colonies of Macedonians in Lydia</b> ; others include AGATHEIRA, AKRASOS, DOIDYE, -ESPOURA, HYRKANIS, KOBEDYLE, and THYATEIRA; see also Appendix III. Although there is evidence indicating that Seleukos I founded Thyateira and that the settlers at Hyrkanis worshipped Zeus Seleukeios, the earliest information about most of the other colonies dates from the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , i.e., the period of Attalid rule. Nevertheless it is likely that the Macedonian colonies were founded by the Seleucids rather than the Attalids. This is because the available evidence indicates that Macedonians are frequently found in the Seleucid army; on the other hand, they are rarely found in the Attalid. For example, Polyaenus (4.9.5) says that in his campaign against Demetrios Poliorketes in 286/5 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Seleukos I Nikator sent out Lysias with a "great number" of Macedonians. Polyaenus (7.39) also mentions a revolt under a Seleukos (either I or II) that was put down by Macedonian and Thracian troops. And Antiochos I had Macedonians under his command in his war against the Gauls (Lucian <i class="italic">Zeuxis</i> 11). The gap in our literary sources for the third century means that, except for Egypt where the papyri fill in, we know very little about the composition of the Hellenistic armies until Polybius and other</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_224" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">224</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_224"></div>
        <p>sources pick up after 221 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> At that point we begin to get information about Macedonians in the Seleucid army. Thus we know of Macedonians or men armed in Macedonian fashion serving in the army of Antiochos III at Raphia in 217 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Polyb. 5.79.4f., 82.2-11), at Thermopylae in 190 (Livy 37.40.1; App. <i class="italic">Syr</i> . 32), in the army of Antiochos IV at Jerusalem (Joseph. <i class="italic">AJ</i> 12.252 and Hieronymus, <i class="italic">FGrH</i> 260 F50), and at Daphne in 167/6 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Polyb. 30.25.5). In contrast we find only one definite reference to Macedonians in the Attalid army: when they were granted citizenship after the death of Attalos III in 133 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 338.14). Irrespective of whether or not the soldiers in the armies of Antiochos III and IV were real Macedonians or only armed "in the Macedonian fashion" (so, for example, Polyb. 5.82.10), the contrast between the evidence for the Seleucids and the Attalids is telling; see also Launey, <i class="italic">Recherches</i> , 335-36; Magie, <i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 973-74.</p>
        <p>Of course there were Attalid foundations in Lydia that included Macedonians in their population: APOLLONIS and PHILADELPHEIA, for example. Both of these were founded in the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Undoubtedly the Macedonians were former Seleucid military colonists. It is a reasonable supposition, therefore, that, with the exception of Apollonis and Philadelpheia, most of the Macedonian colonies in Lydia attested under Pergamene rule were an Attalid inheritance from Seleucid rule.</p>
        <p>The period when Seleucid kings actually controlled western Asia Minor was relatively short: during the reigns of Seleukos I in the few months between Korupedion and his death, of Antiochos I, and of Antiochos II. After the death of the latter the careers of Antiochos Hierax, Achaios, and Attalos I, who was only too willing to take advantage of Seleucid weakness, effectively destroyed central Seleucid control over most of Asia Minor west of the Taurus Mountains. Antiochos III was briefly able to reassert his control over much of the area until, after the Peace of Apameia in 188 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , the Seleucids were permanently removed from western Asia Minor. Of these rulers one thinks of the energetic Antiochos I (so Hansen, <i class="italic">Attalids</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 174)—or perhaps Antiochos II—as a possible founder of Nakrason.</p>
        <p>An inscription from Bakir dated in the first year of a King Attalos (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 268) records the honors decreed for an <i class="italic"> epistates</i> (l. 4) named Apollonios son of Meleager who had previously been a <i class="italic">strategos</i> of the city (l. 10). The inscription also mentions the <i class="italic">prytaneion</i> (l. 15) and <i class="italic"> tamias</i> of the city (l. 20). If the decree could be assigned to Nakrason, it would provide useful information about the civic organization as early as 240 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and show that Nakrason was already then under Attalid control (see Keil, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Nakrasa"; Magic, 980). However, identification of the king as Attalos I is not certain; L. Robert suggests the king may be Attalos II or III. Furthermore he claims that the stele could just as easily have come from Akrasos or Stratonikeia, since inscriptions from all three cities have in the course of time been brought to Bahir and Kirkagaç (<i class="italic">VAM</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 36 n. 6, followed by Magic who suggests [980] that the polis of <i class="italic">OGIS</i> 268 may be Pergamon). A number of scholars in the nineteenth century confused Nakrason and Akrasos: Smith,</p>

        <p>In describing Philadelpheia Strabo comments on the frequency with which it was hit by earthquakes and expresses surprise at the founding of the city (12.8.18 and 13.4.10). Nevertheless it <i class="italic"> was</i> founded, and it flourished, thanks to the fertility of its soil—to which Strabo alludes—and to its location on the main roads from Pergamon and Sardis to Laodikeia and southern Asia Minor.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> Strabo adds that the constant tremors frequently caused cracking in the walls of houses of the city. As a result many of the inhabitants preferred to live in the country, outside the city walls.</p>
        <p>The founder of Philadelpheia, according to Stephanos (s.v. no. 1), was Attalos II Philadelphos (159-138 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> ).<sup class="superscript">2</sup> The presence of the Macedonian shield on coins of the town indicates that Macedonians were among the earliest settlers and hence that it originated as a military colony.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> An honorific inscription, most likely dating to the period soon after the colony's founding, was voted by </p>

        . From the mention of <i class="italic"> politai</i> and ephebes we may conclude that even at this early stage in its development Philadelpheia had the accessories of a polis. In the general area of Philadelpheia there was at least one other colony, at Kobedyle.<sup class="superscript">4</sup>

        <p>Philadelpheia suffered extensive damage in the major earthquake of 17 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> that devastated much of western Asia Minor.<sup class="superscript">5</sup> Under Tiberius the city was renamed "Philadelpheia Neocaesarea," perhaps in gratitude for the emperor's help in rebuilding it.<sup class="superscript">6</sup> This name persisted until Claudius.

        <p>1. Jones claimed that Philadelpheia was a refoundation of the old Lydian town of Kallatebos (<i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 54) and that the organization of Philadelpheia by guilds in the Imperial period originated in the Lydian (i.e., pre-Greek) town (see also Ramsay, <i class="italic">CBP</i> , 105-6). However, the site of Kallatebos is not definitely known (Magie, 799; see also G. Radet, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 15 [1891] 373-80; Bürchner, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Kallatebos"). Broughton has correctly pointed out that the evidence for a guild organization, being from the Imperial period, is so late as to render Jones's suggestions questionable (<i class="italic">AJP</i> 62 [1941] 106). Seven tribes are attested from the Imperial period at Philadelpheia (<i class="italic">IGR</i> IV.1632 and LW III.656); these apparently also functioned as guilds. Their precise nature, however, remains unclear (see N. Jones, <i class="italic">Public Organization</i> , 358; Magie, <i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 1008; Jones, <i class="italic">CERP</i>

         (KP III.20). It is not clear, however, whether this refers to a settlement that preceded the Attalid colony or to an abandoned section of the city (see comments of Keil and von Premerstein, loc. cit.). Cf. the <i class="italic">palaia polis</i> at KOLOPHON; L. Robert, <i class="italic">RPh</i> (1936) 158 n. 6.
        <p></p>
        <p>2. Regarding the <b class="bold">founder of Philadelpheia</b> , J. and L. Robert mention an inscription of Imperial date in the Manisa museum that refers to "King Attalos." They suggest this may have been the base of a statue set up in honor of the city's founder (<i class="italic">BE</i> [1958] 436; L. Robert, <i class="italic">RPh</i> [1976] 186). Joannes Lydos (<i class="italic">De mensibus</i> , ed. R. Wuensch, p. 113.5-6) was certainly incorrect in claiming the city was an Egyptian foundation. Undoubtedly he (or his source) was misled by the name and assumed the town had been founded by Ptolemy Philadelphos.</p>
        <p>3. For the <b class="bold">Macedonian shield</b> on the coins of Philadelpheia see, for example, <i class="italic">Inv.

Head is inclined to date these and certain other coins (cf. <i class="italic">BMC Lydia</i> , 187-89, nos. 1-23; <i class="italic">SNG</i> [von A] 3057-61; <i class="italic">SNG</i> [Cop] <i class="italic">Lydia</i> 337-51) to the second and first centuries <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (see also L.

If this dating is correct, as is likely, it would mean that Philadelpheia developed very early into a polis. Imhoof-Blumer, on the other hand, claims that no coins were minted before Augustus (<i class="italic">Lyd. Stadt</i> ., 113). Cf. the Macedonian shield on coins of APOLLONIS and MYLASA.

        <p>Stratonikeia on the Lydian-Mysian border has suffered neglect at the expense of the more famous like-named city in Caria. It is nowhere specifically mentioned in the ancient literature. It does appear, however, in Byzantine sources: Stephanos (s.v. "Stratonikeia") confused it with the Carian city.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> On the other hand, the Council of Ephesos records a Lydian Stratonikeia, and the <i class="italic">Notitiae</i> distinguish it from the Carian settlement.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> Epigraphic and numismatic evidence from the second and first centuries <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> confirm that the name of the foundation was Stratonikeia and that the inhabitants were identified as "Stratonikeians of Indeipedion." Around this time a town of the Indeipediatai existed as a separate entity. Under Trajan the two cities were connected in a sympolity, as is evidenced by their jointly issuing coinage.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> In 123 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> the two cities were absorbed into Hadrian's new foundation of Stratonikeia-Hadrianopolis.<sup class="superscript">4</sup></p>
        <p>Stratonikeia was probably founded by Antiochos I and named for his wife, Stratonike. Later it fell under the control of Aristonikos, who minted cistophori there.<sup class="superscript">5</sup> Aristonikos was subsequently besieged and captured by the Romans at Stratonikeia.<sup class="superscript">6</sup> Epigraphic evidence for the existence of a <i class="italic">prytanis</i> , gymnasiarch, ephebarch, secretary of the ephebes, and lists of ephebes from the late second or early first century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> shows that at the time Stratonikeia was still a polis.<sup class="superscript">7</sup> After this, however, we have no more evidence from it until Roman times. The Roman coinage extended from Trajan to Gallienus.</p>
        <p>The general location of the town is indicated by a coin of the third century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> of Stratonikeia with a river god and the legend KAIKO<span class="Symbol">S</span> Discoveries in the nineteenth century by Earinos and Radet of pieces of columns and of inscriptions of Hadrianopolis-Stratonikeia at a site between the villages of Siledik and Yagmurlu (approximately fifty-two kilometers east of Bergama and eighteen kilometers northeast of Kirkagaç) have fixed the site of Stratonikeia.<sup class="superscript">8</sup></p>

        <p>1. Tscherikower groups this Stratonikeia with cities in Mysia (20-21). In fact, early references to Stratonikeia do not indicate where it was located, or confuse it with the Carian city, while later references (fifth century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> and later) place it in Lydia (see below). As a result Robert refers to it as Stratonikeia on the Kaikos (<i class="italic">VAM</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 43 and n. 1; cf. also Robert, <i class="italic"> BCH</i> 102 [1978] 437 n. 2). Eutropius (4.20.2) and Orosius (5-10.4-5) both mention the capture of Aristonikos by the Romans at a city called Stratonikeia (not otherwise specified, though it was undoubtedly the one in Lydia; see below).

The following coins and inscription of Stratonikeia in Lydia are incorrectly ascribed to the Carian city: Mionnet, 3: 378, nos. 437-39 and Suppl. 6: nos. 486-87, 496, 502, 504-6; Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">M.

        <p>In an interesting and challenging article K.J. Rigsby has suggested (<i class="italic">TAPA</i> 118 [1988] 130-37) that <i class="italic">OGIS</i> 338, which was found at PERGAMON, was not, as usually accepted, a decree of that city. He believes that the stone was a "pierre errante" that was removed from another city and brought to Pergamon during the Imperial period or later. Briefly, Rigsby's main argument (131-34) for removing the decree from Pergamon is that the dating formula—by a priest alone—is not found in any other Pergamene document. Contra, P. Gauthier (<i class="italic">BE</i> [1989] 279; see also <i class="italic">SEG</i> XXXVIII.1263, 1266), who argues that eponymous priests are in fact found at Pergamon.</p>
        <p>According to Rigsby, the city whence the stone might have come was Stratonikeia in Lydia. If 1 understand him correctly, Rigsby argues that the occurrence of both "Stratonikeians" and "Stratonikeians of Indeipedion" in the extant Pergamene ephebic lists (see above) indicates "that distinct Stratoniceas are represented in the two usages of the ephebic lists" (136). Furthermore he claims that the two Stratonikeias were located close to each other. He then suggests that the town of the Indeipediatai originated as Stratonikeia of Indeipedion and "from its creation stood in sympolity with the original Stratonicea" (136). This having been said, Rigsby sensibly comments that he is arguing only a possibility and admits the fragility of his hypothesis (136).</p>
        <p>As a parallel to Stratonikeia being in the immediate vicinity of Stratonikeia of Indeipedion Rigsby cites the case of <b class="bold">AMYZON</b> in Caria and Amyzon </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00310.gif"></figure>

         (<i class="italic">I. Priene</i> 51.5; see J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">Amyzon</i> , 577-79). On the other hand, it is also possible that the two Stratonikeias were quite far apart. In his discussion of Stratonikeia L. Robert suggested that "of Indeipedion" served to distinguish this city from other "homonymous cities" (<i class="italic">VAM</i>
        <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 52-53). Presumably Robert had in mind, as Rigsby suggests (136), STRATONIKEIA in Caria. In fact we should be careful about articulating any rules or guidelines for differentiating between the occurrence of the simple ethnic for a city and the ethnic with a distinguishing element. For example, in the case of APAMEIA Kelainai the availiable evidence suggests that on documents from the city the simple ethnic was used. Only as one proceeds farther away do we find a distinguishing element (see also Habicht, <i class="italic">JRS</i> 65 [1975] 81). On the other hand, in <i class="italic">I. Perg</i> . 13 one finds three references to PHILETAIREIA by Ida. In one instance the town is simply called "Philetaireia"

(Originally Imhoof-Blumer attributed all the cistophori to Thyateira; however, he later changed his view and classified coins having the legend A<span class="Symbol">P</span> O<span class="Symbol">L</span> with Apollonis, <span class="Symbol">S</span> TPA with Stratonikeia, and

Robert (first edition of <i class="italic">VAM</i> , 48-49), on the other hand, suggested that the dates were regnal years and since Eumenes II ascended the throne in 197 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , the Stratonikeian coin dated to 194. Furthermore, since Eumenes was not betrothed to Stratonike until 188 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> (Livy 38.39.6; see Magie, 770-71), Robert argued that the city must have been named for Antiochos I's wife and therefore must have been founded by him (<i class="italic">VAM</i> , 48-49, followed by Ruge, <i class="italic">RE</i> Suppl. VII: 1247; and Magie, 978). Hence Robert claimed it was a Seleucid foundation. However, in 1954 E. S. G. Robinson demonstrated that the Eumenes of the cistophori was not the Attalid king but rather his bastard son Aristonikos, i.e., Eumenes III (<i class="italic">NC</i> ser. 6, vol. 14 [1954] 1-8). Thus, as Robinson pointed out (6), Stratonikeia could have been founded by Eumenes II. In the second edition of <i class="italic">VAM</i> (252-57) Robert acknowledged the cogency of Robinson's numismatic arguments but pointed out correctly that this still did not exclude the possibility that Stratonikeia had been a Seleucid foundation (256). Robert noted that Stratonike was honored throughout western Asia Minor: <i class="italic">(a)</i> STRATONIKEIA in Carla was defmitely a

         belongs to the period 132-130 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> rather than 196-186 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> undermined the arguments for dating the origins of the cistophori to the third century. In recent years arguments have been proposed for various dates in the first half of the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ("discussion on the beginning of the cistophorus has produced almost as many dates as authors," K. W. Harl, <i class="italic">Cl. Ant</i> . 10 [1991] 271). 1 give below a selection of opinions (for a review of the scholarship see D. Kienast, <i class="italic"> JNG</i> 11 [1961] 159-88; Kleiner, <i class="italic">ECC</i> , 10-16; Le Rider <i class="italic"> JS</i> [1989] 164-69; R. Bauslaugh, <i class="italic">NC</i> [1990] 61-62).
        <p></p>
        <p>In four places Livy mentions cistophori in the loot taken by the Romans in 190, 189, and 187 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> : the triumph of M'. Acilius Glabrio over Antiochos III and the Aetolians in 190 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (37.46.3), the naval triumph of L. Aernilius Regillus over Antiochos in 189 (37.58.4), the triumph of L. Cornelius Scipio over Antiochos in 189 (37.59.4), and the triumph of Cn. Manlius Vulso over the Galatians in 187 (39-7.1)-At first glance this should be strong and conclusive evidence that the cistophori were already in circulation before 190 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> This position has been argued most recently, for example, by Allen (<i class="italic">Attalid Kingdom</i> , 112-13, "before, although not long before, 188 BC") and Harl (268-94). However, the Aetolians and the Seleucids based their silver coinage on the Attic tetradrachm. Furthermore, the presence of cistophori, which did not normally circulate outside the Attalid kingdom, in the loot of triumphing Roman generals is puzzling. The Romans were, after all, allies of the Attalids. As one possibility Harl suggested (291) that the money may have</p>

        <p>come from the future Seleukos IV when he raided the Attalid kingdom in 190; i.e., he captured many cistophori that fell into Roman hands after the battle of Magnesia. This is unconvincing and in any event does not adequately explain the presence of the cistophori in <i class="italic">four</i> triumphs. Alternatively, Haft suggested that it was "even more likely that the sums reported in triumphs represent(ed) payments of indemnities by cities of Asia Minor to Roman commanders." The historical problem in Livy's text has caused many scholars to dismiss his testimony as an anachronism; see, for example, R. Thomsen, <i class="italic">Early Roman Coinage</i> (Copenhagen, 196) 2: 146-48. Price (<i class="italic">KME</i> , 240) linked the introduction of the coinage to the events following the Peace of Apameia in 188 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and suggested that cistophori were in circulation by 180. He noted the presence of a single cistophors in a hoard that dates to 168-167 (<i class="italic">IGCH</i> 237). The cistophorus in question belongs to series 23 of Kleiner and Noe's arrangement (<i class="italic">ECC</i> , 92) and could, according to Price, date to before 180 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> Bauslaugh concurred (61-64); he suggested that in the period 188-183, while the Seleucids were paying off the war indemnity to the Pergamenes (Polyb. 21.42.20; Livy 38.38.14) the latter continued to use the Attic standard. The period after this may mark, according to Bauslaugh, the beginning of the cistophoric coinage. This is certainly a reasonable hypothesis. Mørkholm argued for the first peaceful period for the Attalids after 188 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , 179-172 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , and thus opted for c. 175 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 24 [1979] 47-50); Le Rider (<i class="italic">JS</i> [1989] 16-69) suggested the period between c. 185-180 and c. 175-170 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Kleiner (<i class="italic">ECC</i> , 16-18; <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 25 [1980] 45-48) suggested a date around 1660 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , after the defeat of the Gauls. H. Nicolet-Pierre (<i class="italic">KME</i> , 208-12, following B. V. Head, <i class="italic">NC</i> [1880] 145-46) proposed a still later date, c. 159 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when Attalos II came to the throne.</p>
        <p>6. Regarding <b class="bold">the site of Aristonikos' capture</b> , both Eutropius (4.20.2) and Orosius (5. 10.4-5) say it was Stratonikeia without specifying whether it was the one in Caria or in Lydia. Favoring the former were among others Foucart (quoted by Radet, <i class="italic"> REA</i> 6 [1904] 161), Holleaux (<i class="italic">Ét</i> ., 2: 193-94), and L. Robert (<i class="italic">Ét. anat</i> ., 465; the first edition of <i class="italic">VAM</i> , 48). However, the full discussion by Broughton (<i class="italic">CPh</i> 29 [1934] 252-54) has shown that in fact the city in Lydia was where Aristonikos was taken. This is now the generally accepted view (thus Hansen, <i class="italic">Attalids</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 157; Magie, 1042 with bibliography). In the second edition of <i class="italic">VAM</i> (261; also <i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 11-12 [1960] 59 n. 5) Robert changed his mind and followed Broughton; he pointed out further that the attribution of the cistophori of Stratonikeia to the fourth year of Aristonikos "settled the question."</p>
        <p>7. According to Imhoof-Blumer (<i class="italic">Lyd. Stadt</i> ., 29, 36, followed by Head, <i class="italic">BMC Lydia</i> , cxvi) after the capture of Aristonikos, Stratonikeia was probably reduced to the status of a village in the territory of Thyateira; it regained its independence under Trajan and was refounded by Hadrian. Jones thought it was punished for its support of Aristonikos by the confiscation of the territory of the Indeipediatai (<i class="italic">CERP</i>

The strongest argument against these views is the epigraphic evidence for the continuation of a <b class="bold">polls structure at Stratonikeia</b> into the first century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ; see A.

        <p>There were various traditions in antiquity that Thyateira had once been called Semiramis, Pelopeia, and Euhippia. In fact it is doubtful if these names were ever actually used. As for the name "Thyateira" it is probably Asiatic. "Teira," which is found in other place-names, is apparently a Lydian term for "fortress" or "town." This suggests that Thyateira was an old Lydian town that predated the arrival of the Seleucids.<sup class="superscript">1</sup></p>
        <p>The colony at Thyateira was one of the oldest of the Hellenistic settlements. It was probably founded by Seleukos I in the short period between his victory</p>

        <p>over Lysimachos at Korupedion and his death (i.e., 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ). By 274 there definitely was a colony at the site: a dedication to Apollo Pityaënos dated to the thirty-seventh year of the Seleucid era survives. A number of inscriptions mention the presence of Macedonians, as does Strabo, who refers to Thyateira as a "Macedonian settlement" (13.4.4). The military organization of the colony can be seen in the dedication made to Seleukos by the "officers and soldiers" (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 211). We also have evidence for the existence of a gymnasium. The fact that in one inscription the colonists are described as "in" (<i class="italic">en</i> ) and in another as "around" (<i class="italic">pen</i> ) Thyateira suggests that perhaps they may have been divided into urban and rural groups.<sup class="superscript">2</sup></p>
        <p>The history of Thyateira in the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> is imperfectly known. In the early part of the century its inhabitants, if not its territory as well, suffered at the hands of the Galatians. In the inscription recording the dedication to Apollo Pityaënos of 274 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> the dedicator mentions his son who had been captured by the Galatians. The town and the surrounding region continued in Seleucid hands until c. 226 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> From c. 226 to 223 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Attalos I controlled the area. The Seleucids then regained it, only to lose it to the Attalids again in 218 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> —for how long we do not know. Attalos held the city in 201 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> when Philip V marched toward it (Polyb. 16.1.7). Once again we do not know how long after this date the city remained in Pergamene hands.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> In any event, in 190 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> the territory <i class="italic">circa Thyatiram</i> as well as the city iself was under Seleucid control, and in that year Antiochos III encamped near the town.<sup class="superscript">4</sup> By the terms of the treaty of Apameia the town and the surrounding region were included in the newly enlarged Attalid kingdom.</p>

         Clerc comments that the Menedemos inscription is one of the oldest from Thyateira and may date from the first successors of Alexander (398). Referring to <i class="italic"> BCH</i> (1887) 466, no. 32, Radet said that on the basis of letterforms it compares with the Menedemos inscription (466). Launey thought the Menedemos inscription may date to as early as the end of the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> If Launey is correct, we would have evidence for the presence of Macedonians at Thyateira sometime before the presumed founding of the colony by Seleukos 1 (<i class="italic">Recherches</i> , 338). From Roman Thyateira an epitaph of Marcus son of Menophanos Lagidas survives (<i class="italic">KP</i> II.79 [= <i class="italic">TAM</i> V.2.1106] and the commentary of Keil and von Premerstein; see also L Robert, .<i class="italic">NInd</i> ., 118).

        <h2 class="Heading-Heading3"><a href="#d0e20538" class="heading-link">Alexandreia by Latmos</a></h2>
        <p>Stephanos records a total of eighteen Alexandreias (s.v.). The tenth, called "by Latmos," was in Carla. Stephanos adds that it had a sanctuary of Adonis in which there was a statue of Aphrodite by Praxiteles. This is all that is known about Alexandreia by Latmos.</p>
        <p>Two possibilities have been proposed for the town that was subsequently renamed Alexandreia: Alinda<sup class="superscript">1</sup> and Herakleia by Latmos.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> Furthermore, four possible founders have been suggested: the Carian queen Ada, Alexander the Great, Lysimachos, and Antigonos Monophthalmos. The fact that Herakleia by Latmos was probably refounded as Pleistarcheia suggests that Alinda may have been renamed Alexandreia. According to Arrian (<i class="italic">Anab</i> . 1.23.8), Alinda, which is where Queen Ada resided, was "a place amongst the strongest in Caria."<sup class="superscript">3</sup> When Alexander came to Caria she met him, surrendered Alinda, and adopted Alexander as her son. Hence it is reasonable to surmise that Alinda was renamed at that time and that, in gratitude to her adopted son, Ada possibly effected this change.</p>
        <p>If Alinda did become Alexandreia by Latmos, it did not entirely lose its original name. By the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , if not earlier, the old name was in regular use.<sup class="superscript">4</sup> Alinda itself has thus far yielded no inscriptions. The identification of the site (still unexcavated) at Karpuzlu is considered certain by the discovery there of Alindean coins.<sup class="superscript">5</sup></p>
        <p>1. For <b class="bold">the identification of Alexandreia by Latmos and Alinda</b> see, for example: Droysen, <i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 2: 662; L. Robert, <i class="italic">Sinuri</i> , 59 n. 3; Laumonier, <i class="italic">Cultes indig</i> ., 432; Bean, <i class="italic">TBM</i>

Robert, <i class="italic">Amyzon</i> , 6. Droysen also bases this identification on an Alindean coin (Mionnet, Suppl. 6: 445, no. 55, Caracalla and Plautilla) that portrays a Praxitelean Aphrodite on the reverse. Berve was not inclined to accept the Alinda-Alexandreia equation (<i class="italic">Das Alexanderreich</i> , 2:12 n. 1).</p>
        <p>2. Radet (<i class="italic">De Coloniis</i> , 25), Tscherikower (28-29), Jones, and Errington (see below, note 3) suggested that the new city may have been the renamed <b class="bold">Herakleia by Latmos</b> . If Herakleia was renamed Alexandreia, the new name did not last. An inscription from Herakleia dating to the early second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> records a letter sent by Zeuxis to the <i class="italic">boule</i> and <i class="italic">demos</i> of Herakleia (M. Wörrle, <i class="italic"> Chiron</i> 18 [1988] 421ff.).</p>
        <p>Tarn describes Stephanos s.v. "Alexandreia 10" as insoluble and then hazards an untenable suggestion that someone <i class="italic">may</i> have confused Herakleia in Caria with Herakleia in Media (<i class="italic">Alexander</i> , 2: 242).</p>

          <hr id="JD_Page_246"></div>
        <p>3. <b class="bold">Four combinations have been proposed for the founder of Alexandreia and the native city that was renamed</b> : (1) Queen Ada renamed Alinda (Droysen, <i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 2: 662). Errington is uncomfortable with this possibility because it would mean that the first Alexandreia was founded not by Alexander but by a Carian queen. Furthermore Errington claims that the silence of our sources about this "perhaps argues against it" (<i class="italic">Alexandre le grand</i> , Fondation Hardt Entretiens 22 [Geneva, 1976] 165-66 and n. 4). Neither of these objections is convincing. (2) Alexander renamed Alinda (Hornblower, <i class="italic">Mausolus</i> , 314 and n. 156). Although various cities in Asia Minor maintained traditions that Alexander was their founder (see Appendix II), it is not likely that he actively began to establish colonies until after the battles of Issos and Gaugamela. Of course it is possible that he gave permission to Ada to rename Alinda. On Arr. <i class="italic">Anab</i> . 123.8 see Hornblower, <i class="italic">Mausolus</i> , 314 n. 152. (3) Herakleia by Latmos was renamed Pleistarcheia by Pleistarchos and then Alexandreia by Lysimachos (Jones, <i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 42, 385 n. 23; see also Hadley, <i class="italic">JHS</i> 94 [1974] 63). Errington (162-66) objects to this because Strabo says </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00328.gif"></figure>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00329.gif"></figure>
         (13.1.26) Errington understands this to mean that each of the Successors (except Kassandros) founded an Alexandreia (or possibly, in the case of Seleukos, an Alexandropolis) before going on to found other cities named for themselves. The Greek, however, is not so restrictive. Jones's suggestion, for which he provides no argumentation, should be considered speculative, as should Errington's hypothesis. (4) Herakleia by Latmos was first renamed Alexandreia by Antigonos Monophthalmos, and then Pleistarcheia by Pleistarchos (Errington, 166-67). Errington suggests that Pleistarchos did this essentially to spite both Alexander and Antigonos. We do know that Antigonos and Demetrios carried on extensive operations in Caria (see Billows, <i class="italic">Antigonos</i> , 208-9). Nevertheless the absence of any evidence connecting Antigonos to Herakleia renders this sequence of foundirags unlikely.

        <p>In a particularly confused entry ("Antiocheia 11 in Caria") Stephanos says that Antioch in Carla was founded by Antiochos son of Seleukos.

        <p>on Antioch is unreliable. He says the city used to be called Pythopolis; but elsewhere (s.v. "Pythopolis") he says the same for Nysa. He mentions that Antioch was named in honor of Antiochos' mother, Antiochis. But Soter's mother was Apama, and the mother of Antiochos III was Laodike. Pliny says (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.108): <i class="italic"> Antiochia ubi fuere Symmaethos et Cranaos oppida</i> . Undoubtedly this means Antioch was formed by a synoecism of these two villages. A bronze coin from Antioch (<i class="italic">SNG</i> [von A] 2421) has on the reverse the figure of a man and the inscription </p>

        <p>The city itself was located on the south bank of the river, at the point where the Morsynos River, flowing north from Aphrodisias, enters the Maeander (Pliny <i class="italic">NH</i> 5.108).

        <p>If Stephanos' information that the founder of Antioch was "Antiochos son of Seleukos" is correct, this can be, as I have said, either Antiochos I or III. I believe it unlikely that it was the latter. In the aftermath of the "War of the Brothers" (c. 239-236 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), the final defeat of Antiochos Hierax, and later the revolt of Achaios (220-213) Seleucid control of Asia Minor in general and Caria in particular weakened considerably to the point where, for much of the last quarter of the third century, it was practically nonexistent. The absence of Seleucid control in Caria can be seen in the Antigonid presence in parts of Caria after 227, Attalid pressures from the north, Rhodian inroads from the south, Ptolemaic possession of various coastal cities, and the rise of an independent dynast like Olympichos (see J. Crampa, <i class="italic">I. Labraunda</i> , 123-31; Schmitt, <i class="italic">Antiochos</i> , 243-48; Huss, <i class="italic">Aussen</i> ., 193-200). It is, of course, true that Antiochos III had contact with western and southwestern Asia Minor. After his "anabasis" to the east, Antiochos traveled to southwestern Asia Minor in 204 or 203 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ; furthermore he was in Caria in 197 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when he brought part of it back under Seleucid control. We also have evidence for Antiochos III maintaining contact with a number of cities in Caria: for example, Iasos (D. Levi and G. Pugliese Carratelli, <i class="italic">Annuario</i> 39-40 [1961-1962] 578, no. 5 [= <i class="italic">I. Iasos</i> 5]; <i class="italic">Annuario</i> 45-46 [1967-1968] 445, no. 2 [= <i class="italic">I. Iasos</i> 4]—a letter from Laodike to Iasos and a decree of the Iasians in response; the king and queen in the documents are Antiochos III and his wife, Laodike III; Pugliese Carratelli's identification of the queen as Laodike II was correctly challenged by the Roberts, <i class="italic">BE</i> [1971] 621; on the other hand, the Roberts' attempt to join this inscription to <i class="italic">OGIS</i> 237 [incorporated into <i class="italic">I. Iasos</i> 4 as lines 51-62] has been correctly challenged on epigraphic grounds by C. V. Crowther, <i class="italic">BICS</i> 36 [1989] 136-38; see also <i class="italic"> SEG</i> XXXIX.1110 and references cited there), Herakleia by Latmos (M.

Robert, <i class="italic">Amyzon</i> , 133, no. 4), SELEUKEIA Tralleis (<i class="italic">RC</i> 41), and NYSA (<i class="italic">RC</i> 43). Beyond Caria, we know that Antiochos HI restored SARDIS after its destruction, sent out JEWISH COLONISTS to Lydia and Phrygia, recognized the games associated with Artemis Leukophryene at Magnesia on the Maeander (<i class="italic">RC</i> 31), bestowed various benefactions on Teos (P. Herrmann, <i class="italic">Anadolu</i> 9 [1965] 29ff.), extended his control over Lycia (J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">Amyzon</i> , 154, no. 15<sup class="superscript">B</sup> ; in general see pp. 176-191 for Seleucid administration in Asia Minor under Antiochos III), and probably founded the KARDAKON KOME there. Nevertheless, Caria at the end of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> was remote, falling away from Seleucid control and the prey of many. I do not believe, therefore, that Antiochos III founded Antioch on the Maeander.</p>

        <p>Stephanos (s.v. "Eumeneia") mentions a Eumeneia in Phrygia and a second one in Carla. And in his list of Carian cities Pliny says: <i class="italic">est Eumenia Cludro flumini adposita, Glaucus amnis</i> (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.108). These references prompted scholars of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to search for and try to identify a Eumeneia in Carla. But Robert has shown that at <i class="italic"> NH</i> 5.108 Pliny mistakenly inserted a group of Phrygian place-names in his list of Carian cities. Furthermore, in describing the areas traversed by the Maeander Pliny lists, in order, <i class="italic">Apamenam primum pervagatur regionem, mox Eumeneticam, ac deinde Hyrgaleticos campos, postremo Cariam</i> (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5. 113). From this passage it is dear that the region of Eumeneia was in Phrygia and <i class="italic">not</i> in Carla. Obviously, therefore, we cannot use Pliny as evidence for the existence of a Eumeneia in Carla. As a result we are left with the doubtful authority of Stephanos as our sole evidence for a Eumeneia in Caria. And this is not sufficient.</p>

He tells us that Nysa resulted from a synoecism of three towns that were founded by three brothers, Athymbros, Athymbrados, and Hydrelos. Undoubtedly Athymbra served as the kernel for the later Nysa.

Stephanos does not specify which Carian Herakleia he has in mind, though certainly it would be "by Latmos" rather than "Salbake."<sup class="superscript">1</sup> The founder of Pleistarcheia was undoubtedly Pleistarchos the son of Antipater and the brother of Kassandros. An inscription from Tralleis records the dedication of a statue of "Pleistarchos Antipatrou." Furthermore, three inscriptions have been discovered in Carla that were dated by "Pleistarchos": at Hyllarima (year three), at the temple of Sinuri near Mylasa (year seven), and at Euromos (dating lost).<sup class="superscript">2</sup> The cumulative epigraphic evidence confirms that this Pleistarchos is the dynast rather than a local magistrate.</p>
        <p>We do not know when Pleistarcheia was founded nor in fact when Pleistarchos first gained control of part of Caria. We do know that Pleistarchos first received Cilicia after Ipsos and held it until dislodged by Demetrios Poliorketes in 299 or 298 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Plut. <i class="italic">Demetr</i> . 31.4-32.3). Presumably Pleistarchos also received Caria after Ipsos. Based on the epigraphic evidence for a rule of at least seven years, we may suggest that Pleistarchos' hegemony in Caria extended from 301 until at least 295 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> It was in this period that Pleistarcheia will have been founded.<sup class="superscript">3</sup></p>
        <p>It has been claimed that the massive city walls were constructed by Pleistarchos, but the attribution is very uncertain.

Two of the persons had the toponymic "Ptolemaieus" (ll. 6, 16). It is quite probable, therefore, that the Ptolemais of the Kaunian dedication is the same as that in the Laodikeian decree. In the Kaunian dedication we see Ptolemais as a deme of Kaunos, in the Laodikeian decree as an independent city. Thus we can now locate Ptolemais in the general region of Kaunos. Kaunos was located at the modern village of Dalyan.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> Unfortunately we do not know the precise location of Ptolemais, nor do we know the founder. However, inasmuch as Ptolemy II Philadelphos was active in the interior of Caria and elsewhere along the southern coast of Asia Minor, it is possible he founded this Ptolemais as well.<sup class="superscript">4</sup></p>
        <p>As an independent city, Ptolemais presumably could have minted coins. However, there is no coinage that can definitely be attributed to it.<sup class="superscript">5</sup></p>

        <p>1. The task of filling the lacuna in l. 30 of the <b class="bold">Laodikeian decree</b> (<i class="italic">I. Mag</i> . 59b) is a difficult one. In the first place the stone has disappeared from the Berlin museum. In addition, the reading of the first two letters is uncertain.

         (in a note to <i class="italic"> I. Mag</i> . 59b.30) is not acceptable, because the group of cities in <i class="italic">I. Mag</i> . 59 is centered in Caria, not in Cilicia (Tscherikower, 29). And the length of the lacuna makes

         might fill the gap, and this is certainly a possibility (<i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 7: 190). The town name was normally spelled Kalynda, but the form Kalyndos is found in the Delphic <i class="italic"> theorodokoi</i> list (A. Plassart, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 45 [1921] 6, col.

If after, it would bear witness to the persistence of the name Ptolemais, even in the period following the departure of the Ptolemies. Furthermore, we do not know if the toponymic "Ptolemaieus" is being used to indicate a deme of Kaunos or a foreign town detached (presumably by the Rhodians) from Kaunos; see further, Bean, 24-25.</p>

        <p>passed to the Seleucids. Stratonikeia was named, according to Stephanos (s.v. "Stratonikeia"), in honor of Stratonike, the wife of Antiochos. This suggests the founder was Antiochos I. Stratonikeia was one of the cities that received the Delphic <i class="italic"> theoroi</i> in c. 230-220 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>

        <p>Subsequently Rhodes acquired Stratonikeia through "the great favor of Antiochos and Seleukos" (Polyb. 30.31.6). The identity of Antiochos and Seleukos is a major crux.<sup class="superscript">4</sup> A possible reconstruction suggests we are dealing with Seleukos II and Antiochos III. Under this hypothesis Stratonikeia first passed to Rhodes during the reign of Seleukos II (246-226/5 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ). Around 200 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> it came briefly under the control of Philip V of Macedon and was retaken by Rhodes with the help of Antiochos in 197 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> (Livy 33.18.22).<sup class="superscript">5</sup> It then remained under Rhodian control until 167, when it was declared free and independent by the Romans.

The demes were the old Carian villages in the territory of Stratonikeia.<sup class="superscript">7</sup> A Macedonian month name (Loios) is found in the decree of 268 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> in honor of Nonnous (<i class="italic">I.

        <p>Strabo tells us that Stratonikeia had within its territory two important temples, that of Hekate at Lagina and that of Zeus Chrysaoreus (14.2.25). A third important temple was that of Zeus Panamaros at Panamara. The temple of Zeus Chrysaoreus was the center of the Chrysaoric League.<sup class="superscript">9</sup> The earliest specific reference to this league is a decree of 267 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> engraved at Labraunda (<i class="italic">I.

Strabo also adds that the temple was "near" Stratonikeia (14.2.25). This is the only indication of its location; the site of the temple has not been discovered with certainty.<sup class="superscript">10</sup></p>
        <p>Stratonikeia was east of Mylasa, on the site of the present village of Eskihisar.<sup class="superscript">11</sup></p>

          , <i class="italic">Stratonikei in Caria</i> (Ankara, 1976).</p>
        <p>1. The <b class="bold">question of the earlier name(s) of Stratonikeia</b> is a complicated one. While Pausanias says that both the <i class="italic">polis</i> and the <i class="italic">chora</i> of Stratonikeia were originally called Chrysaoris (5.21.10), Stephanos says that Chrysaoris was the original name of the city called Idrias (s.vv. "Idrias" and "Chrysaoris"). He also quotes Epaphroditus that Chrysaoris was the name for all of Caria. And earlier Herodotus had said (5.118) that Idrias was the <i class="italic">chora</i> from which the Marsyas flowed; see further Oppermann, <i class="italic">Zeus Panamaros</i> , 9-12; Laumonier, <i class="italic"> Cultes indig</i> ., 194-95; Magie, 1032; Sahin<a name="d0e23754-ref" href="#d0e23754" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          , 7ff.</p>
        <p>Stephanos also says (s.v. "Stratonikeia") that the name of the town was later changed to Hadrianopolis. This is incorrect. Stephanos has confused this Stratonikeia with the like-named town in Lydia that changed its name under Hadrian (L. Robert, <i class="italic">VAM</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 43).</p>
        <p>2. For the <b class="bold">Ptolemaic inscription of 274</b>
          <span class="smallcaps"><b class="bold">B.C.</b></span> see J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic"> Mélanges Lévy</i> , 553-68 (= <i class="italic">SEG</i> XV.652 = <i class="italic"> I. Strat</i> . 1002; for the dating to 274 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> see M. Wörrle, <i class="italic">Chiron</i> 8 [1978] 212-16). An inscription from Labraunda (<i class="italic">I. Labraunda</i> 43) records an honorific decree of the Chrysaoric League of 267 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> proposed by a Mylasan. The decree, which was dated to the nineteenth year of King Ptolemy, was in honor of Apollonios, the <i class="italic">oikonomos</i> of King Ptolemy, and was engraved at Labraunda. This indicates that at the time Stratonikeia had not yet been established as the regular center for the League. This prompted C. Habicht to suggest (<i class="italic">Gnomon</i> 44 [1972] 169 n. 1) that the region around Stratonikeia was lost by the Ptolemies after 267 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , i.e., around 259/8 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , and thus that Antiochos II might have been the founder. However, the publication in 1980 of an inscription from Yatagan, which is near the site of Stratonikeia, reopened the question of the founder (M. Ç. Sahin<a name="d0e23805-ref" href="#d0e23805" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          , <i class="italic">ZPE</i> 39 [1980] 211-12, no. 3 = <i class="italic">I. Strat</i> . 1030; cf. <i class="italic">I. Strat</i> . 1001). The inscription, which is dated to the reign of "King Antiochos and his son Antiochos" in the forty-fourth year of the Seleucid era (268 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), records a decree in honor of Nonnous, who bore the ethnic Koliorgeus, a future deme of Stratonikeia (see below, note 7). If, as is likely, the decree was passed by Stratonikeia, this would indicate that the city had been founded by Antiochos I rather than by his son. For the <b class="bold"> attribution of the founding to Antiochos I</b> rather than to Antiochos II, see J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">Mélanges Lévy</i> , 563 nn. 1 and 2. Stratonike was the wife of Antiochos I (and earlier, Seleukos) as well as the mother of Antiochos II. But Stephanos' indication that the city was named in honor of Stratonike "the wife of Antiochos" favors Antiochos I as the founder (see Fraser and Bean, <i class="italic">Rhodian Peraea</i> , 102).</p>
        <p>There are two possible indications, neither convincing, that Seleukos I Nikator might have founded Stratonikeia. First, Appian (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 57) lists a Stratonikeia among the foundations of Seleukos. But the short time that Seleukos was in western Asia Minor in the period between Korupedion and his death makes it unlikely that either Stratonikeia in Caria or Lydia were his. Appian's notice may be an error, or it may possibly refer to Stratonikeia in Mesopotamia (Pliny <i class="italic">NH</i> 6.118).</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_271" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">271</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_271"></div>
        <p>Second, in the 1980 <i class="italic">ZPE</i> article Sahin<a name="d0e23843-ref" href="#d0e23843" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          also published a fragment of a letter written by "King Seleukos" and found at Stratonikeia (211, no. 1 <i class="italic">= I. Strat</i> . 1001). Sahin<a name="d0e23849-ref" href="#d0e23849" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          dated the letter palaeographically to the "beginning of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ," i.e., to Seleukos I Nikator. Seleukos I did take some interest in Caria in the short time between Korupedion and his death: for example, he may have founded APOLLONIA Salbake, and he (and his son Antiochos) communicated with an official regarding the Plutonium at NYSA. It is possible, therefore, that he wrote the fragmentary letter at about the same time. The question is, to whom? Sahin<a name="d0e23855-ref" href="#d0e23855" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          restores the formulaic </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00398.gif"></figure>
         in line 1. However, there is nothing to indicate whether Seleukos was writing to a city rather than to some officials (as he did in the case of Nysa, <i class="italic">RC</i> 9) or a village (as Attalos III did to Hierakome, <i class="italic">RC</i> 68). Hence we cannot use this document as proof that Stratonikeia was in existence at the time. Finally, is it possible that this letter was written by Seleukos II? In that regard it is well to recall that we do have a decree of APOLLONIA Salbake dated to the sixty-ninth year of the Seleucid era (242 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ) in the reign of Seleukos II (<i class="italic">MAMA</i> VI.154).

Some of the deme names have survived in the demotics, written out or abbreviated, that are attested in inscriptions from Panamara and Lagina. Thus: Borandeis, Hierokometai, Koliorgeis, Koraieis, Koranzeis, Loboldeis, Londargeis, Panamareis, Tarmianoi, Themeseis, Tral[leis] or Tral[deis], ...ondreis; see Laumonier, <i class="italic">Cultes indig</i> ., 197ff. Nonnous, the honoree of <i class="italic">I. Strat</i> . 1030 (268 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), had the ethnic (and future demotic) Koliorgeus. The demotic of Lagina is never found under its own name after the establishment of Stratonikeia; but as the most frequently discovered demotic in the Stratonikeian inscriptions is Hierokometes, Robert had suggested it refers to Lagina (<i class="italic">Ét. anat</i> ., 556-59). However, an inscription from the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> records </p>

        <p>10. Regarding the <b class="bold">site of the temple of Zeus Chrysaoreus</b> , Laumonier, <i class="italic">Cultes indig</i> ., 200-201, points to Herodotus (5.118), who mentions a place, Leukai Stelai, near the Marsyas River, which, Herodotus says, was a meeting place for the Carians. But, as Laumonier notes, Herodotus does not indicate whether this was the sanctuary of Zeus Chrysaoreus. The fact that the earliest definite evidence for the Chrysaoric League comes from Labraunda prompted Crampa to suggest that at this time the League "as such did not yet exist" (<i class="italic">I. Labraunda</i> , 1: 34; cf. 2: 50). On the location of the temple of Zeus Chrysaoreus "near" Stratonikeia see Laumonier (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 60 [1936] 322-24), who suggests that some ancient remains 4 km east of Eskihisar may be those of the sanctuary.

        <p>According to Strabo (12.8.14) Antioch near Pisidia was settled by colonists from Magnesia on the Maeander.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> While the founder is not definitely known it was probably Antiochos I.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> Further evidence for the relationship between the two cities may be seen in an inscription (<i class="italic">I.

At two places in the surviving portion (79.15, 80.12) the decree refers to the </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00408.gif"></figure>
         that existed between the two cities. The inscription also indicates that at this tune Antioch had a <i class="italic">boule, demos, strategoi</i> , and <i class="italic">grammateis</i> . It is possible that the <i class="italic"> vici</i> of the later Roman colony at Antioch replaced the tribes of the Hellenistic town.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> The Magnesian month name Smision is attested in <i class="italic">I. Mag</i> . 81.7, which is probably an Antiochene decree. Antioch may have contained a large Thracian population. In 1922 Ramsay announced the discovery of an "inscription of pre-Roman time ... containing a list of citizens [of Antioch], all Thracians." Unfortunately the inscription was never published.<sup class="superscript">4</sup> A large statue of a seated Zeus, a type frequently found on Seleucid coins, has been found at Antioch.<sup class="superscript">5</sup> The earliest extant coinage dates from the late first century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>

        <p>Strabo says (12.3.31) that Antioch was located near the temple of Men Askaenos. The remains of the temple, which dated from Hellenistic times, have been identified at Kara Kuyu, a high peak just southeast of the city. Strabo also says there was a second temple of Men in the <i class="italic">chora</i> of Antioch; the remains of this have not yet been found.<sup class="superscript">8</sup></p>
        <p>Antioch, which was in Phrygia near Pisidia, was adjacent to the site of the modern Yalvaç. Coinage with the river god Anthios calls attention to Antioch's location on that river.<sup class="superscript">9</sup></p>

        ) Antioch and one in the <i class="italic"> chora</i> of Antioch, Anderson, following a suggestion of Ramsay, hypothesized that the temple near the city was built at the time of the founding of the city, while the one farther out was pre-Hellenistic, <i class="italic">JRS</i> (1913) 267-68; see also Levick, <i class="italic"> JHS</i> 91 (1971) 82-83; Mitchell, <i class="italic">AS</i> 33 (1983) 9 and 34 (1984) 10; Boffo, <i class="italic">Re ellenistici</i> , 282-86. In a private communication Stephen Mitchell has kindly provided the following information regarding the temple at Kara Kuyu: "6 × 11 Ionic on a stepped krepis; built ?150 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ; possible Attalid patronage; some similarities in the ground plan of this and a smaller temple in the sanctuary with that of Zeus Sosipolis at Magnesia on the Maeander." Ramsay suggested (<i class="italic">ABSA</i> 18 [1911-1912] 37ff., esp. 72; <i class="italic">JRS</i> 8 [1918] 113) that the earlier temple was located at Sagir 21 km north of Antioch; see also Levick, <i class="italic">RCSAM</i> , 44, 86-87; <i class="italic">JHS</i> (1971) 82-83. E. N. Lane pointed out (<i class="italic">CMRDM</i> 3: 55) that Men was also worshipped at Magnesia on the Maeander. However, Lane noted that the evidence from Magnesia is late (the Severan period); furthermore each town has a peculiar iconography. As a result, he suggests the cult had an independent development in each place. Strabo gives the surname of Men as 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00415.gif"></figure>
         (12.3.31). The inscriptions, however, usually have 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00416.gif"></figure>

        <p>Strategically located at the junction of the roads that join Phrygia and Pam-phylia to Lydia and Ionia, Kelainai was already an important city under the Persians. According to Xenophon (<i class="italic">Anab</i> 1.2.7-8) it was the site of a palace of Cyrus, a fortified palace of the Great King, and a large park. Not surprisingly Alexander chose it to be the capital of the satrapy of Phrygia. As such it was the residence of Antigonos Monophthalmos.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> Later Antiochos I Soter moved the inhabitants of Kelainai to a nearby site in the plain in front of the Sultan Dag, close to the confluence of the Marsyas and Maeander rivers. There he founded Apameia, naming it after his Bactrian mother.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> While the new name was used on coins, official documents, and Byzantine lists, the old was not forgotten and continued to be used by poets and prose writers throughout antiquity.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> The Seleucids maintained a palace at Apameia (Livy 35.15.6). From an epigram of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> we learn that a certain Gaul, Brikkon, considered Apameia to be his <i class="italic">patris</i> . Other evidence shows the presence of natives and Iranians in Apameia. An honorific inscription for a gymnasiarch, Kephisodoros, was voted by the <i class="italic">boule</i> in the time of Eumenes II (<i class="italic">MAMA</i> VI.173). Among other things, Kephisodoros had erected cult statues of Eumenes and Attalos in the gymnasium.<sup class="superscript">4</sup> The earliest coins definitely attributable to Apameia are dated to after the period of Attalid rule.<sup class="superscript">5</sup></p>
        <p>The town name and the ethnic had a number of variant forms. On inscriptions from the town and nearby, as well as on coins, it is simply "Apameia" or "Apameus." Farther away, a distinguishing term was often added. Nicolaus of Damascus referred to it as "Phrygian Apameia" (in Ath. 8.332f). A list of victors from Samos mentions an </p>

        <p>1. L. Robert has called attention to the evidence for Iranians who were established at <b class="bold">Kelainai when it was under Persian rule</b> (e.g., <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 83, nos. 83-84, a Hellenistic bronze of Apameia with the Iranian name Maiphernes; see further <i class="italic"> NInd</i> ., 348-49; <i class="italic">BCH</i> 107 [1983] 504; <i class="italic">BCH</i> 108 [1984] 471). The precise location of Kelainai vis-à-vis Apameia is not known; see Ruge and Magie; cf. Ramsay, 398, 412-13. For Kelainai under Alexander, Antigonos, and Eumenes, who wintered there in 321 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> see Magie, 983; Bosworth, <i class="italic">Comment</i> ., 173 and references cited there; see also Wehrli, <i class="italic">Antig</i> ., 80; Billows, <i class="italic">Antigonos</i> , 296, who suggests that prior to the advent of Antiochos "the population of Kelainai already contained a large Greco-Macedonian element and that this was due to Antigonos" (cf. Tscherikower, 155-56).</p>
        <p>2. For <b class="bold">Antiochos I as the founder of Apameia</b> see Strabo 12.8.15. Orth (<i class="italic">König. Macht</i> ., 141 n. 11. followed by Mehl, <i class="italic">Seleukos Nikator</i> , 301 n. 50) claimed Seleukos I as the founder. He referred to Livy (38.13.5) and Solinus (p. 167.8-10, ed. Mommsen, second edition). The former mentions <i class="italic"> novaeque urbi Apameae nomen inditum ab Apama sorore Seleuci regis</i> . Two points: Apama was Seleukos I's wife, not his sister. It is not clear whether Livy simply erred (so Berve, <i class="italic">Das Alexanderreich</i> , 2: 52 n. 2) or whether he was reflecting Seleucid and Ptolemaic usage of the term "sister" as an honorific title (so Radet, <i class="italic">RPh</i> [1893] 58; see also Holleaux, <i class="italic"> Ét</i> ., 3: 180; Orth, <i class="italic">König. Macht</i> . 72. On Apama see L. Robert, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 108 [1984] 467-72). Furthermore the Latin says the town was named for Apama but does not indicate who was the founder. Solinus <i class="italic">does</i> specifically say that Seleukos founded Apameia. However, inasmuch as Seleukos first came into possession of Phrygia after his victory over Lysimachos at Korupedion in 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (see APOLLONIA in Phrygia), it is highly unlikely that he would have had the opportunity to found Apameia. That fact and the superior authority of Strabo favor Antiochos I as the founder. (Hirschfeld, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Apameia 6," claimed Antiochos III <i class="italic">Soter</i> (<i class="italic">sic</i> ) as the founder; this (typographical?) error for Antiochos I is perpetuated in the <i class="italic">Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae</i> s.v. "Apameia," 874). For the name "Apameia" on coins and official inscriptions see below. "Apameia" is also found in Hierokles (673.4) and the <i class="italic">Not. Ep</i> . 1.46, 2.49, etc.</p>

        <p>3. Tscherikower (33), following Ramsay (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 430), suggested that the use of the name "Kelainai" was revived in the second century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> In fact, as L. Robert pointed out (<i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 2 [1946] 76), the old name was continuously used in antiquity by poets and prose authors; see, for example, Livy 38.13.7; Ov. <i class="italic">Fast</i> . 4.363; App. <i class="italic">Syr</i> . 36; Paus. 10.30.9; Dio Chrys. <i class="italic">Or</i> . 35; and further references in Ruge, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Kelainai." Apameian coins with representations of the hero Kelainos, Zeus Kelaineus, and Dionysos Kelaineus are quite common (e.g., <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 88ff., nos. 114, 117, 185; A. Löbbecke, <i class="italic">ZfN</i> 15 [1887] 49). A metrical epitaph on a sepulchral stele from Sardis, which was dated by L. Robert, on the basis of the letterforms, to the mid-third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , refers to the town as "Kelainai" (<i class="italic">AJA</i> 64 [1960] 53-56). The epitaph is for a woman, Matis; the name could be Greek or Phrygian (Robert, 55).</p>
        <p>4. The <b class="bold">epigram for the Gaul</b> was originally published by G. Daux, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 92 (1968) 924, then republished with commentary by C. B. Welles, <i class="italic">Klio</i> 52 (1970) 477-90 (see esp. p. 482). The appearance of the name </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00426.gif"></figure>
         prompted Welles to conclude that this was the Spartan king Areus I and, hence, the reference was to the Chremonidean War. This, of course, would have dated the epigram to the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> However, L. Robert has correctly noted that the name refers to the god Ares rather than to the Spartan king (<i class="italic">BE</i> [1971] 415; see also Orth, <i class="italic"> König. Macht</i> ., 141 n. 11). Hence we must set aside, as Robert noted, Welles's dating of the inscription. For evidence of natives and Iranians at Apameia see Robert, op. cit., 55-56; id., <i class="italic">NInd</i> ., 348ff.

         reverses, while a double flute (the attribute of the Phrygian Marsyas) appears on the A<span class="Symbol">P</span> A coins. Kleiner argued that the coins were actually minted at Pergamon for Apameia: <i class="italic">ECC</i> , 86-96; <i class="italic">Essays Thompson</i> , 119-30, esp. 120-21; and <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 25 (1980) 48-52. Unhappy with the great distance between Pergamon and Apameia, Møorkholm argued against a connection between the two cities. In 1979 he revived an old hypothesis of Du Mersan (<i class="italic">NC</i> [1846] 7-9) that the 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00429.gif"></figure>
         pieces should be attributed to Parion in the Hellespont. Claiming that—among other things—the single- and double-flute symbol are not identical, Mørkholm suggested that the 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00430.gif"></figure>
         coins should be assigned to either Parion or APOLLONIA on the Rhyndakos and not to Apameia (<i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 24 [1979] 53-60, analyzed by Le Rider, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 114 [1990] 686-89). However, two recent discussions have argued convincingly against Mørkholm's suggestion and in favor of Apameia. R. Bauslaugh (<i class="italic">NC</i> [1990] 47 n. 12) pointed to the evidence of Strabo 13.1.14. The latter implies that Parion

        <p>was not a subject city of the Attalid kingdom; this is supported by the existence of autonomous tetradrachms minted by Parion. Furthermore Bauslaugh claimed that the countermarks themselves argue against Mørkholm. Hence he argued convincingly in favor of Kleiner's attribution. Finally Le Rider has added further strong support in favor of the attribution of these cistophori to Apameia (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 115 [1991] 363-65). He pointed out that the monograms found on a number of cistophori normally contain at least the first three letters of the city's name. In the case of the monogram </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00431.gif"></figure>
         this would exclude Parion (the rho is lacking) and Apollonia (the omicron is lacking) but would allow for the attribution to Apameia.
        <p></p>
        <p>A bronze coin of Apameia is variously dated to "circ. 190(?)" by Head (<i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 74, no. 32), the "early second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (?)" in <i class="italic">SNG</i> (Cop) <i class="italic"> Phrygia</i> 160, and "before the time of Augustus or at the beginning" of his reign by Imhoof-Blumer (<i class="italic">Kl.M</i> ., 208, no. 8a).

        <p></p>
        <p>Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> . 5.106) claimed that the town was first called Kelainai, then Kibotos, and, later, Apameia. But it is hardly likely, as Habicht says (81), that Kibotos was ever the actual name of the town. For coins with chests on the reverse see, for example, Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">Kl.M</i> ., 211-12, nos. 19-20; <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 96, nos. 155-58; <i class="italic">SNG</i> (Cop) <i class="italic">Phrygia</i> 211-12; <i class="italic">SNG</i> (von A) 3492-93; Trebilco, 90-91. For Apameia in the <i class="italic">conventus</i> list see Habicht, p. 65, col. II.18.</p>
        <p>7. For a review of the various attempts to explain the term "kibotos" see Habicht, 81; Magie, 983-84 and references cited there. Briefly, Hirschfeld noted (<i class="italic">AKAW</i> [1875] 15) that since merchandise arrived at Apameia in chests, the surname "Kibotos" reflected the city's commercial importance. As regards the </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00433.gif"></figure>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00434.gif"></figure>
         in the <i class="italic">conventus</i> list, Habicht remarked that "wherever an ethnic is made more precise by the addition of a phrase constructed with 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00435.gif"></figure>
        , geographical names always seem to follow: regions, place-names, mountains, etc." (81). Habicht admitted to being unable to offer a satisfactory solution to the problem. He did, however, quote a letter from C. P. Jones, who wrote: "It would seem to imply that 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00436.gif"></figure>
         was some place in the region.... I wonder if the 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00437.gif"></figure>
         could be the acropolis on which the old Kelainai stood, which on Hirschfeld's drawings looks rather like a chest" (81 n. 146). Far less likely is Ramsay's suggestion (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 669-72, followed by Tscherikower, 32) that as a result of a local flood legend (Plut. <i class="italic">Parallela Graeca et Romana</i> 5 [306E-307A]; Trebilco, 89-90) the Jewish community of Apameia designated one of the local mountains as the resting place of the ark and furthermore influenced the choice of "Kibotos" for Apameia. Among other things, the appearance of two, three, and five <i class="italic">kibotoi</i> (rather than just one) on certain Apameian coins (see above, note 6) undercuts this hypothesis (see Magie,
        <p></p>

        ; both probably refer to the same place. Athenaeus (3.81a) says Apollonia was also called Mordion. Strabo twice (12.6.4 and 12.8.13) calls the city Apollonias.
        <p></p>
        <p>2. For <b class="bold">the suggestion that Apollonia was an Attalid foundation</b> named in honor of Apollonis, the mother of Eumenes II, see, for example, Hirschfeld, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Apollonia 21"; cf. J. and L. Robert, however, who have correctly noted that a settlement named for Apollonis probably would have been called that (so APOLLONIS in Lydia) rather than Apollonia; see L. Robert, <i class="italic"> REA</i> 36 (1934) 525-26; J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">La Carie</i> , 2:239 and n. 2. Hence, based on the toponym alone, we should not consider Apollonia an Attalid settlement. For <b class="bold">the inscription recording a cult of Nikator</b> see <i class="italic">MAMA</i> IV.226 (<i class="italic">=SEG</i> VI.592 = W. M. Ramsay; <i class="italic">Klio</i> 23 [1930] 243-44). There are a number of problems regarding this inscription. The stone was found at Büyükkabaca near the ancient Tymandos, which was four hours east of Apollonia; hence the stone may come from either town (<i class="italic">MAMA</i> IV, p. xiii). Furthermore, in the lack of other evidence the dedication does not prove Seleukos was the founder (see Habicht, <i class="italic">Gott</i> .<sup class="superscript">2</sup> 105; also Magie, 1315; Bickerman, <i class="italic">IS</i> , 244 n. 1.

          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 411 n. 10; both accept <i class="italic">MAMA</i> IV.226 as evidence for Seleukos as founder). Finally, Seleukos first came into possession of this region after defeating Lysimachos at Korupedion in 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">nota bene</i> that Appian's remark [<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 55] that Seleukos received Phrygia in the partition after the battle of Ipsos is incorrect; see Meyer, <i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 28; Mehl, <i class="italic"> Seleukos Nikator</i> , 212-14). It is unlikely that he had the opportunity to found a settlement here in the months between Korupedion and his death. Of course this does not exclude the possibility that one of his successors, perhaps Antiochos I or II, founded Apollonia. But this is speculation. On the duration of the Seleucid presence in Pisidia see SELEUKEIA in Pisidia; see also Bevan, <i class="italic">House of Seleucus</i> , 1: 323; Meyer, <i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 28; G.

In fact these coins were minted under the Severan emperors and reflect the idolization of Alexander that was characteristic of that age. O.

M.

         abound, and certainty is not attainable (in general see Magie, <i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 1315; L. Robert, <i class="italic">NInd</i> ., 357 and n. 2). Over a century ago Waddington (in LW commentary to III.1195 and <i class="italic">RN</i> [1853] 179) called attention to Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5-95), who described the <i class="italic">Milyae</i> as <i class="italic"> Thracum suboles</i> . Now Milyas is the name of a region of southern Asia Minor. There was little agreement in antiquity as to its precise boundaries. In any event, Herodotus said (1.173; see also Strabo 12.8.5) that it was the original name of the area called Lycia. However, by late Hellenistic and Roman times it apparently designated a region northwest of Pamphylia, bounded roughly by Termessos on the south and the Pisidian frontier on the north (Strabo 13.4.17; for the <i class="italic">testimonia</i> beating on Milyas and a full discussion see A. S. Hall, <i class="italic">AS</i> 36 [1986] 137-52; and earlier, Bosworth, <i class="italic">Comment</i> ., 157-58; Walbank, <i class="italic"> Comment</i> ., 1: 598; and esp. Magie, <i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 761-62). Waddington also called attention to the fact that Alexander used Thracians as guides when, having left Phaselis, he sent part of his army through the mountains to Perge (Arr. <i class="italic">Anab</i> . 1.26.1). Waddington thus suggested that the colonists at Apollonia were Milyadeis and that they wanted to recall their heritage on coins and inscriptions, just as, for example, the inhabitants of SYNNADA advertised their Ionian and Dorian heritage. Anderson (<i class="italic">JHS</i> [1898] 96) thought that Apollonia may have been a Seleucid foundation info which the Attalids later introduced Thracian colonists; admitting the difficulty of understanding the term <i class="italic"> kolones</i> , he hypothesized that it might have been "adopted in a spirit of rivalry with the Augustan 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00456.gif"></figure>
        , such as Antioch." Ramsay suggested (<i class="italic">JRS</i> 12 [1922] 184 and <i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 400) that the Seleucids settled the Thracians and that as a countermeasure to these the Lycians were brought in possibly by the Attalids. Jones (<i class="italic">CERP</i>
        <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 411) believed that the use of the term <i class="italic">kolones</i> indicated the Lycians and Thracians were settled at Apollonia by the Roman government and that the settlers were possibly veterans of Amyntas' army. Calder (<i class="italic">AS</i> 6 [1956] 51) thought that the Thracians and Lycians were settled in Seleucid times and that

        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00458.gif"></figure>
        . Finally, Stephen Mitchell pointed out that all the epigraphic and numismatic references except one read 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00459.gif"></figure>
         (<i class="italic">Proc. X Int. Cong. Cl. Arch</i> ., 1: 314-18). The exception is Ramsay, <i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 172: 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00460.gif"></figure>
        . Mitchell suggested that 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00461.gif"></figure>
         is a misreading and that rather than translating "of the Apollonians and the Lycian and Thracian colonists" one should translate "of the Apollonians, the Lycians, the Thracians and the colonists." This reading would have reinforced a previous suggestion made by J. and L. Robert (<i class="italic">BE</i> [1958] 467; contra, Levick, <i class="italic">RCSAM</i> , 17 n. 6) that along with the Lycians and Thracians there was another category of colonists. However, Ramsay's reading of 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00462.gif"></figure>
         was <i class="italic">not</i> an error. In 1987 T. Drew-Bear republished <i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 172 (<i class="italic">Un castellum romain près d'Apamée de Phrygie</i> [Vienna, 1987] 16, no. 1); his text confirmed the presence of a 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00463.gif"></figure>
        . Despite this, the Roberts' suggestion has merit, and we should consider the possibility, as Mitchell speculated, that the <i class="italic">kolones</i> were Roman colonists. With the division of the population at Apollonia suggested by Mitchell

        <p>we may compare the evidence from a recently published inscription. Fragments of this were found at the villages of Kozluca and Bogaziçi, approximately 30 km southwest of Burdur in the region of ancient Milyas (Hall, <i class="italic">AS</i> [1986] 139). The inscription, which is dated to 5/4 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , records a dedication made jointly by three groups: the Milyadeis, Roman <i class="italic">negotiatores</i> (or </p>

        ), and Thracians (
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00466.gif"></figure>
        ). We thus have epigraphic evidence for Thracians in Pisidia that is possibly a century earlier than the epigraphic and numismatic evidence at Apollonia and NEAPOLIS. Like the Thrakes at Apollonia, the "Thracians living among them" were probably descended from the Hellenistic colonists. It is not clear, incidentally, whether they were originally settled in colonies and later dispersed or whether they were originally settled throughout the area.

Robert, <i class="italic">La Carie</i> , 2: 258-59; von Aulock, <i class="italic">MSPisid</i> ., 2: 52, nos. 1-8. For the coinage of the Imperial period see von Aulock, <i class="italic">MSPisid</i> ., 2: 52-63. For two coin types of Apollonia in Phrygia under Tiberius previously attributed to Apollonia Salbake see M. Grant, <i class="italic">NC</i> (1949) 150-56. For coins of Apollonia with the Maeander symbol, which Waddington had attributed to the Phrygian city (<i class="italic">RN</i> [1853] 180) but which in fact belong to APOLLONIA on the Maeander, see the latter entry.</p>
        <p>5. The first appearance of the name <b class="bold">Sozopolis</b> is in 381 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> at the Council of Constantinople (Mansi, <i class="italic">Sac. Concil</i> ., 3: 570). See also, for example, Hierokles 673.1 and <i class="italic">Not. Ep</i> . 1.373, 2.438, etc. For Sozopolis see G. Hirschfeld, <i class="italic">Monatsbenchte</i> (1879) 318; Ramsay, <i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 400-401; Ruge, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Sozo(u)polis 1." It is probable that Sozopolis was not just a simple renaming of Apollonia but was in fact a different place; see Ramsay, op. cit.; Ruge, op. cit., who also suggests that Stephanos' "Sozousai" is probably Sozopolis. Note that Apollonia in Thrace also had the name Sozopolis from the third century <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span> (Oberhummer, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Sozopolis 2"; Ramsay, <i class="italic"> JRS</i> 12 [1922] 185), and in Cyrenaica, Apollonia became Sozousa.</p>
        <p>6. The <i class="italic">Tabula Peutingeriana</i> (IX.2) places Apollonia between Apameia and Antioch. Stephanos records Apollonia 17 as being in Pisidia and Apollonia 18 as being in Phrygia. As mentioned above, both probably refer to the same Apollonia that was, like ANTIOCH near Pisidia, in the frontier region of Phrygia that bordered on Pisidia. Strabo (12.6.4 and 12.8.13) places Apollonia in Phrygia; cf. Ptol. 5-4-9: </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00467.gif"></figure>
        . Hierokles (673.1) and the <i class="italic"> Not. Ep</i> . (loc. cit.) locate it in Pisidia. Note that Hirschfeld, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Appollonia 21," places the town in Phrygia, while Ruge, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Sozo(u)polis," reflecting Byzantine geography, puts the latter in Pisidia.

Thus he assigns this coinage to Blaundos. Le Rider's suggestion is clever and attractive, especially when combined with his hypothesis that the nearby DIONYSOPOLIS also minted cistophori in the mid-second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Nevetheless there is a problem with this interpretation: it would appear to be anachronistic that the cistophori, which predate 133 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , have the spelling

         as we might expect. However, Le Rider quotes Drew-Bear, who remarks that inasmuch as the two forms of the toponym—with the beta and the mu—coexisted in the second/third century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> , it is quite conceivable that a similar situation existed in the Hellenistic period; see also Drew-Bear, <i class="italic">NIP</i> , 92-93, no. 27, and commentary, 56-59.

        <p>3. There is <b class="bold">no agreement as to whether Blaundos was in Lydia</b> or <b class="bold">Phrygia</b> (see Ramsay, <i class="italic">CBP</i> , 570). The Flavian <i class="italic">conventus</i> list has Blaundos in the district of Sardis (<i class="italic">JRS</i> 65 [1975] 65, col. I.27). And in the Byzantine period it was normally included in Lydia. Thus the <i class="italic">Not. Ep</i> . locate it there (2.182: "Balandos"; 1.162, 3.218, 4.172, etc.: "Blandos"). On the other hand, the Tralleis inscription groups it with Phrygian cities. And Ptolemy lists it among the cities of Phrygia (5.2.17: "Bleandros").

He provides no evidence for this claim. Contra, Imhoof-Blumer (<i class="italic">Kl.M</i> ., 216, note to no. 4), who points to the cult of Poseidon as earthshaker at Apameia, Ankyra, and Eukarpeia and suggests we should interpret Poseidon on the Brouzos coin likewise as earthshaker rather than as the leader of colonists.</p>

        <p>Although it was a member of the "Phrygian Pentapolis," Brouzos does not appear along with Eukarpeia, Hierapolis, Stektorion, and Otrous in the list of cities in the Flavian <i class="italic">conventus</i> list from Ephesos. The reason is not dear. It may be because it was not yet a city in the Flavian period (Habicht, <i class="italic">JRS</i> 65 [1975] 81 and 87).

        <p>1. Radet thought that by Attalos and Eumenes Stephanos meant Attalos I and his son Eumenes II (<i class="italic">De Coloniis</i> , 56), but this is unlikely. As Tscherikower noted (33; see also Robert, <i class="italic"> VAM</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 260), Attalos I ruled over Phrygia for a very short time. Furthermore we know that Eumenes II acted with one of his brothers, probably Attalos II, in founding APOLLONIS in Lydia. Le Rider wondered if Eumenes and Attalos founded Dionysopolis following the defeat of the Gauls in 166 <span class="smallcaps">B.C</span> . in order to protect the Maeander valley (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 114 [1990] 701). This is a reasonable speculation. Ramsay suggests that Dionysopolis was founded by the Attalids to counter the Seleucid Blaundos (<i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 44 n.; cf. L. Robert, <i class="italic">RA</i> [1934] 90-91). Ramsay also claimed that in 222 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> Dionysopolis celebrated the 400th anniversary of its founding (<i class="italic">Social Basis</i> , 82; <i class="italic"> JÖAI</i> 27 [1932] Beiblatt 250-52). Apparently his sole evidence is <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 186, no. 24. Now this coin does commemorate the 70th anniversary of the refounding by Antoninus Pius.

        <p>4. The <b class="bold">location of Dionysopolis</b> has been the subject of much discussion. Ramsay originally placed it on the left (south) bank of the Maeander, near the modern Ortaköy and hence close to the sanctuary of Apollo Lairbenos. He—mistakenly—believed the city was founded on land taken from the sanctuary (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 126-31). On Apollo Lairbenos see <i class="italic">MAMA</i> IV, pp. xv and 95-115; Oppermann, <i class="italic">RE</i> Suppl. V, s.v. "Lairbenos," 521-35; Broughton, "Roman Asia," 681-82; K. M. Miller, <i class="italic">Numen</i> 32 (1985) 46-70. Ramsay called attention to an inscription found near Ortaköy (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 147, no. 37 = <i class="italic"> IGR</i> IV.758 = <i class="italic">MAMA</i> IV.277) in which the ethnic "Dionysopolitan" occurs. Nevertheless Ramsay himself was aware that the location was far from certain; he also referred to an epitaph of a native of Dionysopolis—<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 147, no. 36—from near Üçkuyu, 4 km north of Bekilli in the northeast Çal Ova on the fight bank of Maeander, and commented: "This place may contest with Orta-Keui the distinction of being the site of the city" (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 128). The editors of <i class="italic">MAMA</i> IV (p. xiv) placed Dionysopolis south of Ortaköy at Sazak.</p>
        <p>In <i class="italic">VAM</i> (first edition, 1935) Robert argued at length—and convincingly—that Dionysopolis should be located on the fight bank of the Maeander somewhere in the region of the Çal Dag and the Çal Ova. Among other things, Robert pointed out that if one wanted to locate Dionysopolis near the temple of Apollo Lairbenos, it was paradoxical that Lairbenos does not explicitly occur in any of the coin types of Dionysopolis and that the Dionysopolitans rarely occur as worshippers at the temple of Apollo Lairbenos (137-39). He also called attention to the provenience of <i class="italic">CBP</i> , 147, no. 37, and to an inscription of Imperial date (<i class="italic">IGR</i> IV.756 = <i class="italic">MAMA</i> IV.315) copied at Bekilli that listed Hierapolis, Dionysopolis, Blaundos, and the Hyrgaleian plain in that order. (Ramsay later changed his mind about the location of Dionysopolis, and in <i class="italic">Social Basis</i> , 80-83, which was published posthumously in 1941, he opted for a location near Bekilli.) Finally, Habicht pointed out (82) the connection between Blaundos and Dionysopolis in Cicero (<i class="italic">Q.Fr</i> . 1.2.4) and called attention to an unpublished inscription found south of Sevliler in the Çal Ova that confirms "that the territories of the Hyrgaleis and of the Dionysopolitae adjoined on the northern bank of the Maeander, that is to say that Dionysopolis was in fact located in the area in which Robert had assumed it was."</p>
        <p>According to Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.106) and the Flavian <i class="italic"> conventus</i> list published by Habicht (p. 65, col. II.21; see also p. 82) Dionysopolis was in the <i class="italic">conventus</i> of Apameia. In the <i class="italic">Not. Ep</i> . (1.452, 2.521, etc.) it is located in Phrygia Capatiana.</p>

        <p>Dokimeion was famous in Roman times for its marble quarries. The marble was known locally as "Dokimite" or "Dokimian," but the Romans called it "Synnadic" (Strabo 12.8.14), apparently because the administrative offices were at Synnada and/or because the marble passed through Synnada on its way to Ephesos and Italy. Mount Persis, the site of the quarries, was portrayed on coins of Dokimeion.<sup class="superscript">6</sup> We do not know the extent to which the quarries were worked in Hellenistic times.<sup class="superscript">7</sup></p>

        <p>1. In the ancient and Byzantine literature the name of the city is variously spelled Dokimia (Strabo 12.8.14), Dokimaion (Ptol. 5.2.17), Dokimeion (Stephanos, s.v.), and Dokimion (Hierokles 677.11; also <i class="italic">Not. Ep</i> . 1.334, etc.).</p>

For the coins of the city with the head of Dokimos and the legend <span class="Symbol">D</span> OKIMO<span class="Symbol">S</span> see, for example, <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 189, nos. 7-9; <i class="italic">Inv.

I do not agree with Ramsay's claim (<i class="italic">Social Basis</i> , 286-87) that Dokimos and Dokimia were "native personal and local names ... of Anatolian character" and that there is no connection between the Macedonian Dokimos and the town Dokimeion. The Dokimos who surrendered Synnada in 302, <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> to Lysimachos may be identical with Perdikkas' general of 319 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> (Diod. 18.45.3; see Kaerst, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Dokimos 4 and 5"; Billows, <i class="italic">Antigonos</i> , 382-83). Hansen thought Dokimos, acting as an agent, founded Dokimeion as a village in the territory of Synnada (<i class="italic">Attalids</i>
          <sup class="superscript"> 2</sup> , 173; cf. Stephanos s.v. "Synnada"). Tarn believed Dokimeion was simply</p>

        <p>a military colony named for the official who founded it (<i class="italic">GBI</i> , 11). Jones, on the other hand, pointed out that Hellenistic kings named cities only after themselves or members of the royal family and never after private individuals. Hence he suggested that Dokimos was acting as an independent dynast and that he founded Dokimeion to be the capital of his princedom (<i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 49; see also Leschhorn, 319). In fact, given the probable early date for the founding, it is possible that the distinction of king, prince, dynast, and agent—and the responsibilities of each—were not fully defined at the time.</p>
        <p>3. Strabo (12.8.14) describes Dokimeion as a "village" (</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00499.gif"></figure>
        ); see also Stephanos s.v. "Synnada" (though in the entry "Dokimeion" he describes it as polis). This reference to Dokimeion as a village is troublesome and led Tscherikower (35; see also Droysen, <i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 2: 711) to suggest it was an error on Strabo's part. Two points should be noted. First, in Roman times <i class="italic">katoikia</i> was often used synonymously with <i class="italic">kome</i> (especially with regard to native villages), occasionally even with <i class="italic">polis</i> (P. Foucart <i class="italic">BCH</i> 9 [1885] 395; V. Chapot, <i class="italic">La province romaine proconsulaire d'Asie</i> [Paris, 1904] 97; Magie, 1022-26). Furthermore, Strabo's use of terms such as <i class="italic">katoikia, kome</i> , and <i class="italic">polis</i> is not always precise (see L. Robert, <i class="italic"> Ét. anat</i> ., 191-94). Thus he (14.2.25) describes STRATONIKEIA in Caria as being a 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00500.gif"></figure>
        , though certainly in his own time it was a polis. Presumably he is reflecting in his own time on the origin of the city. Second, many Hellenistic colonies began their existence as villages (see, for example, the KARDAKON KOME in Lycia [time of Eumenes II]: 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00501.gif"></figure>
         in M. Segre, <i class="italic">Cl. Rh</i> . 9 [1938] 190, ll. 3-4; Cohen, <i class="italic">Seleucid Colonies</i> , 83). Therefore, two possibilities emerge: (1) Dokimeion was originally a native village and not a colony and was still a village in the early first century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> (Ramsay, <i class="italic">Social Basis</i> , 286-87, suggested it did not become a city until c. 51 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> ), or (2) Strabo is using the term retrospectively, as he probably did when he described Stratonikeia as a <i class="italic">katoikia</i> .

There is no numismatic evidence earlier than the time of Augustus.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> Eukarpeia was a member of the so-called Phrygian Pentapolis (the other cities were Otrous, Hierapolis, Stektorion, and Brouzos).

As a result Drew-Bear suggested that the Alexander recorded in the inscription is the great king and that he was considered to be the founder of Eukarpeia. Three comments. <i class="italic">(a)</i> The provenience of the stone is not known. Ramsay says he found it "on a large basis in the cemetery at Tchor Hissar" (<i class="italic">JHS</i> [1887] 478). A decade later he wrote: "When an inscr. is found standing free on an ancient site, it seems fair to conclude that it belongs to that site. Hence I cannot accept the suggestion made in <i class="italic">BCH</i> 1893 p. 278 that this stone may have been brought from Brouzos: that is possible, but probability is against it" (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 702). Legrand and Chamonard, <i class="italic">BCH</i> (1893) 278, erroneously state that Ramsay located Otrous at Koçhisar; in fact, as I mentioned above, Ramsay placed it at Çorhisar (for the location of Çorhisar and Koçhisar see Bede, <i class="italic">TIB</i> VII: 266-27 and map at the end). <i class="italic">(b)</i> Drew-Bear is quite correct in noting that there is nothing to substantiate Ramay's claim that Çorhisar was the site of Otrous. <i class="italic">(c)</i> Drew-Bear is also undoubtedly correct in suggesting that the Alexander mentioned in the inscription is the Macedonian king rather than the Asiarch of the early third century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> (see the discussion in OTROUS).

        <p>In <i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 66, Jones theorized that the "Corpeni" (Pliny <i class="italic">NH</i> 5.105) were "perhaps the tribe which occupied the district later shared between four small cities, Eucarpia, Bruzus, Hieropolis and Otrus, which all issued coins in the second and third centuries <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> Under Augustus coins were struck with the legend 'of the Eucarpitic (district)' ... the district ... was occupied by a tribe called the Corpeni which in the course of Augustus' reign gave to its capital the name of Eucarpia, a Greek name suggested by the tribal name, and began to issue coins with the legend 'of the Eucarpitic (district)'"; note that already in <i class="italic">JHS</i> 8 [1887] 469 Ramsay had replaced "Corpeni" in Pliny's list with the "Eucarpeni." Drew-Bear rightly rejected the etymology "Eukarpeia &lt;&lt; Corpeni" (<i class="italic">BCH</i> [1991] 373-75). Among other things, he pointed out that the correct form of the ethnic was </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00515.gif"></figure>
         not 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00516.gif"></figure>
         (374 n. 55).
        <p></p>
        <p>Drew-Bear suggested that "Corpeni" referred to a city of the same name and not to a tribe. Taking this reconstruction one step farther Drew-Bear suggested that the homeless cistophorus with the legend KOP (Kleiner-Noe, <i class="italic">ECC</i> , 100-101) belonged to the city of the Corpeni. Like Adramyttion (see R. Bauslaugh, <i class="italic">NC</i> [1990] 48), we then would have another example of a short-lived minting of cistophori under the Attalids, this time in Phrygia. The attribution of the KOP cistophorus to the Corpeni is possible, particularly in view of the likelihood that there were cistophori issued by a number of Phrygian cities under the Attalids. Among the cities that possibly issued cistophori were APAMEIA Kelainai, BLAUNDOS, DIONYSOPOLIS, LYSIAS, and SYNNADA. Nevertheless, the presence of a fish on the reverse is puzzling. Perhaps the reference is cultic rather than geographic.</p>
        <p>3. <b class="bold">Location</b> . Ramsay suggested Eukarpeia was located at Emirhisar (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 690-92, followed by Drew-Bear, 374 n. 56; see also Belke, <i class="italic">TIB</i> VII: 250-51 and map at end), but the identification is not secure (see Ruge, in <i class="italic">RE</i> s.vv. "Phrygia," 827; "Eukarpia," 996; and "Otrus," 1888). On the Pentapolis and the location of its cities see Ramsay, <i class="italic">CBP</i> , 678-79; Ruge, <i class="italic">RE</i> . s.v. "Otrus," 1887-88; Belke, <i class="italic">TIB</i> VII: 358. The general area where we should search for Eukarpeia is well defined. Strabo (12.8.13) mentions Eukarpeia along with Peltai, Tabai, and Lysias. Hierokles (676.8ff.) lists it with Hierapolis, Otrous, Stektorion, Brouzos, Debalikia (location unknown; see BROUZOS, note 5), Lysias, and Synnada. The <i class="italic">Tab. Peut</i> . (VIII.5) places it on the road between Dorylaion and Eumeneia (see Ramsay, <i class="italic">CBP</i> , 691). Cf. the <i class="italic">Not. Ep</i> ., where the listing is hierarchic rather than geographic (see above, pp. 7f.): Hierapolis, Eukarpeia, Lysias, Augustopolis, Brouzos, Otrous, Lykaones, and Stektorion (1.343; cf. 2.407, 3.433, etc.).</p>

Eumenes II made an alliance with the Achaian League and as a result received troops from it who fought with him against Antiochos III. The "Eumeneian Achaians" may have been descended from these troops or, perhaps, from others sent to Attalos II. Among the tribes of Eumeneia were two in which the Achaians may have been enrolled, Argeias and Heraïs. Hera was the great Argive goddess, and Argos was a member of the Achaian League. On the other hand, the designation "Achaioi" may simply refer to the mythological origins claimed by the Eumeneians. This ancestry claim can also be seen in the description of the city as <i class="italic">eugenes</i> , a term that denoted a colony-mother city link (real or imagined) between various Hellenized cities of Asia Minor and cities of the Greek mainland.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> The other attested tribal names of Eumeneia are Athenaïs, Apollonis, Demetrias, Artemeisias, and Hadrianis.<sup class="superscript">4</sup> Among the festivals of the city was the Eumeneia Philadelphia, which commemorated the fraternal affection of Attalos Philadelphos and his brother, Eumenes.<sup class="superscript">5</sup> Apollo Propylaios was worshipped at Eumeneia.<sup class="superscript">6</sup> The usual ethnic was

For coins of Apollo holding the double-axe see, for example, <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 217ff., nos. 41-43, 47-49; <i class="italic">SNG</i> (Cop) <i class="italic">Phrygia</i> 394; <i class="italic">SNG</i> (von A) 3590-91. Ramsay thought that Apollo Propylaios was the Greek equivalent of the native Men Askaenos, whose presence in the region of Eumeneia is attested (<i class="italic">IGR</i> IV.739 = Lane, <i class="italic">CMRDM</i> , 1, no. 101) and who also had a double-axe as his symbol (<i class="italic">CBP</i> 356). But in <i class="italic">IGR</i> IV.739 Men Askaenos is listed along with a whole series of other gods. In addition, the double axe was a symbol used by many local divinities in Asia Minor (see Drew-Bear, in <i class="italic">GRBS</i> [1976] 261 and notes; L. Robert, <i class="italic">Hellenica</i> 3 [1946] 61; for the rider god with the double-axe see <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 218ff., nos. 50-51, 59; <i class="italic">SNG</i> [Cop] <i class="italic">Phrygia</i> 396-97; <i class="italic">SNG</i> [von A] 3595, 3597). Ramsay also suggests that the sanctuary of Men Askaenos was at Attanassos near Eumeneia and that Eumeneia was founded on land that had been the property of the Phrygian god (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 355 and 241-43). However, the location of Attanassos (see, for example, <i class="italic">Not. Ep</i> . 1.328, 2.391, etc.) is not known. Furthermore, the theory that Hellenistic (including Attalid) kings seized temple lands for their colonies is problematic (see, for example, Broughton, in "Roman Asia," 643-44; id., <i class="italic">Studies Johnson</i> , 242-43 and n. 25; in general see Magie, 1017).

        <p>1. For the <b class="bold">literary testimonia</b> see Ritti, 3-42. For <b class="bold"> the suggestion that Hierapolis was an old Phrygian holy center</b> see Ramsay, <i class="italic">CBP</i> , 85ff. Magic (987) believed it was sacred to the Great Mother. Stephanos (s.v. "Hierapolis") claimed that the town name originated from the many temples there. Bean referred to a suggestion that the city was named by the Attalids (who he believed had founded it) in honor of Hiero or Hiera, the wife of Telephos, the mythical ancestor of the Pergamenes (<i class="italic">TBM</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 201).</p>
        <p>2. Magie denied that the appearance of "<b class="bold">Macedonians</b> " in inscriptions of Imperial times could be used as evidence that Hierapolis had been a Seleucid military colony (988; contra, Hermann and Swoboda, <i class="italic">Gr. Staatsaltertümer</i>
          <sup class="superscript">6</sup> , 200, n. 13); note, however, that Magie also believed (128) that it might have been the Attalids who refounded Hierapolis. On the likelihood that Macedonian colonies were generally founded by the Seleucids rather than the Attalids see NAKRASON.</p>
        <p>3. The <b class="bold">inscriptions with the tribal names</b> were found on the edges of the scats of the theater of Hierapolis; see Kolb, <i class="italic"> ZPE</i> (1974) 255-70, pl. VIII; Ritti, 118-22, pls. 18-20. The tribes Seleukis, Antiochis, and Laodikis obviously were in honor of the Seleucids, while Eumenis and Attalis paid tribute to the Pergamenes. Stratonikis could have been named either for Demetrios Poliorketes' daughter, who was the wife of Seleukos I and Antiochos I, or for the daughter of Ariarathes IV, who married both Eumenes II and Attalos II. J. and L. Robert prefer the first identification (<i class="italic">BE</i> [1976] 668). For the identification of the tribe Apollonias with Apollo Archegetes rather than with Queen Apollonis, the wife of Attalos I, see Kolb, 262-64. The publication of these inscriptions firmly lays to rest the controversy as to whether Hierapolis was a Seleucid or Attalid foundation (for the various views on the subject see the references cited in Kolb, 255-56 and notes). The new evidence that <b class="bold">Hierapolis was organized into tribes</b> also effectively refutes the suggestion of Ramsay (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 105, followed by Jones, <i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 73) that the city was divided into guilds rather than tribes. Note, however, that Ramsay's suggestion was <i class="italic">ex silentio</i> : he knew about guilds but had no evidence for the existence of tribes; nor did he have any evidence that there had been a "Greek foundation in Hierapolis" (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 105-8; on the evidence for guilds at Hierapolis see Ramsay, op. cit.;Jones, <i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 395 n. 73). W. Judeich has suggested that the names Mailouis (<i class="italic">Alt. v. Hierapolis</i> 70.2), Mamoles (ibid. 81.2), and Motalis (ibid. 344.1; see L. Robert, <i class="italic">VAM</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 141 n. 2) found on Hierapolitan inscriptions were tribal names</p>

In fact the discovery that the tribes at Hierapolis had dynastic names renders it unlikely that the latter three were tribal names of Hellenistic Hierapolis. L. Robert has suggested that these referred to "groupement[s] indigène[s] dans la campagne" (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 107 [1983] 511-15 and <i class="italic">JS</i> [1983] 45-63).

        <p><b class="bold">Founder</b> . Seleukos I came into control of Phrygia as a result of the battle of Korupedion in 281 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> It is, however, unlikely that he had the opportunity to found Hierapolis in the few months that he lived after the battle. The region was then under continuous Seleucid rule only during the reigns of Antiochos I and II. After that it fell away from central Seleucid control as a result of the revolts of Hierax and Achaios. Antiochos III reasserted Seleucid rule over Phrygia after the defeat of the latter in 213 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> . Although there is evidence for Antiochos III founding Jewish colonies in Lydia and Phrygia, there is nothing to indicate that he founded any major settlements in the region. It is most likely therefore that either Antiochos I or II founded Hierapolis. Kolb notes (269) the very close proximity of Laodikeia on the Lykos, which was probably founded by Antiochos II, and suggests that Antiochos II would not have established another city so close to Laodikeia. On the other hand, Antiochos I did found, among other settlements, APAMEIA Kelainai and NYSA in Carla. This prompts Kolb to hypothesize that Antiochos I was also the founder of Hierapolis. This is speculative, as Kolb admits, but it is reasonable.</p>

        <p>In the third and second centuries <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> a petty dynastic family whose chief members were named either Lysias or Philomelos controlled territory in west-central Phrygia.

In the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> a Philomelos ("Philomelos II") son of Lysias ("Lysias III") made a dedication at Didyma (<i class="italic">I. Didyma</i> 458). Depending upon whether we date the Didyma inscription toward the beginning or the end of the second century we can posit two reconstructions: <i class="italic">(a)</i> if the inscription dates from the beginning of the century, then "Philomelos II" is possibly to be identified with the Philomelos ("Philomelos III") who came to the assistance of Termessos during Gn.

The <b class="bold">identification of the founder(s) of the towns of Lysias and Philomelion is not certain</b> ("L'origine de ces deux cités demeure entourée de mystère," Holleaux, <i class="italic"> Ét</i> ., 3: 363). J. G. C. Anderson suggested (<i class="italic">JHS</i> 18 [1898] 107 and n. 1) the founder of Lysias was Lysias I, whom he identified as a "general of Seleucus Nikator in 216 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> " (<i class="italic">sic</i> ). It is certainly possible that a general of Seleukos I Nikator, in that capacity, or after the latter's death, as an independent dynast, founded Lysias (and, perhaps, Philomellon as well). Cf. the situation of DOKIMEION and THEMISONION. Holleaux pointed out (362) that at the beginning of his reign Seleukos II had written to "the kings, dynasts, cities and <i class="italic">ethne</i> " (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 229.11) and that these "dynasts" had acquired their independence in the first half of the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Noting that the Lysias/Philomelos family was probably one such dynasty, he quite reasonably suggested that the state of which Lysias and Philomelion were the chief cities could already have been founded by the time of Seleukos III. Less likely is Leschhorn's suggestion (321) that the founders of the two cities were Lysias II/III (see option <i class="italic"> a</i> above) and Philomelos II. Ramsay's suggestion (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 421 n. 4) that Lysias was a foundation of Antiochos III is unlikely. Walbank's hypothesis that Philomelion was founded by Philomelos I or II (<i class="italic">Comment</i> . on Polyb. 21.35.2; see also Magic, <i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 1313; and Leschhorn, <i class="italic">Gründer</i> , 321) ignores the possibility that it could have been founded by Lysias and named for his father.

        ). The arguments as to whether these originally were Seleucid or Attalid settlements are inconclusive.
        <p></p>
        <p>Ramsay claimed that the letterforms and the fact that Menodoros was from Adramyttion pointed to a date of the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> for the colonies. He also suggested that the Pergamenes established them as a counterbalance to the Seleucid Themisonion (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 258). Schulten (<i class="italic">Hermes</i> 32 [1897] 531-32) suggested the settlements were Seleucid, founded by Antiochos II (see also Haussoullier, <i class="italic">Ét. Milet</i> , 94; Bevan, <i class="italic">House of Seleucus</i> , 1: 166: "probably Seleucid"; and <i class="italic">SEG</i> XXXVIII.1168). Schulten believed that the appearance of Macedonian month names argued against an Attalid origin (loc. cit.; but cf. Samuel, <i class="italic">Greek and Roman Chronology</i> , 126-27). Bickerman hesitated (<i class="italic">IS</i> , 128 n. 6: "j'admets jusqu'à nouvel ordre que le texte est de l'époque séleucide, mais sa date reste incertaine; il peut aussi bien avoir été rédigé sous les Attalides"). Bérard, who originally published the inscription (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 15 [1891] 556-62), argued on the basis of the letterforms for a date in the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> From the mention of <i class="italic">phylakitai</i> and the fact that Menodoros was </p>

         (but cf.

        <p>In 1975 Michael Wörrle published an inscription discovered near Denizli. The inscription, dated to the forty-fifth year of the Seleucid era (267 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), records an honorific decree passed by two villages, Neonteichos and Kiddioukome. Kiddioukome was certainly not a colony. And Neonteichos, despite its name, was probably not one either.</p>
        <p>The inscription was published in <i class="italic">Chiron</i> 5 (1975) 59-87 (for the editio princeps see <i class="italic">Türk Arkeoloji Dergisi</i> 22.2 [1975] 159-62). J. and L.

        <h2 class="Heading-Heading3"><a href="#d0e29117" class="heading-link">Otrous</a></h2>
        <p>The only evidence that supports the suggestion that Otrous may have been a Hellenistic colony is numismatic and of Imperial date. The coinage of Otrous includes two types—a warrior (Otreus) stepping into a galley and Aeneas carrying Anchises and leading Ascanius—which clearly symbolize migration and which may recall an early phase in the history of the town.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> Thus it is possible that Otrous originated as a Hellenistic colony. But more substantial evidence is needed before we can definitely make this claim. The location of Otrous is not known, though the fact that it was a member of the Phrygian Pentapolis (Eukarpeia, Hierapolis, Otrous, Stektorion, and Brouzos) helps place it in the Sandikli, plain.<sup class="superscript">2</sup></p>
        <p>At Çorhisar, which is in the Sandikli plain, an inscription, dated palaeographically to the Imperial period, has been found that read: </p>

         . It is probable that the inscription honors Alexander the Great as the founder of the city. Claims by cities, particularly under the Severi, to have been founded by Alexander the Great were relatively common. Of course the claim, first appearing so long after the career of the great king, is not sufficient evidence to posit the existence of a Macedonian colony. Furthermore we do not know from which ancient settlement the inscription came. Ramsay has suggested that Çorhisar is the ancient Otrous.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> This is, however, only a conjecture.

        <p>1. For <b class="bold">coins (third century</b>
          <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span> ) portraying the warrior on the galley and Aeneas see, for example, <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 345, nos. 12, 14; <i class="italic">Inv. Wadd</i> . 6368-69, 6371; <i class="italic">SNG</i> (von A) 3905, 8430, 8431; see also F. Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">Nomisma</i> 5 (1910) 33, no. 30. The tradition of a Phrygian migration from Europe to Asia Minor and then within Asia Minor was an old one in Greek literature. Both Herodotus (7.73) and Strabo (10.3.16), for example, mention the migration of Phrygians from Europe to Asia Minor. And in the <i class="italic"> Iliad</i> (3.184-89) Priam tells Helen how he fought with the Phrygians, who were led by Otreus and Mygdon, against the Amazons; see also K. Regling, <i class="italic">Klio</i> 8 (1908) 489; P. Carrington, <i class="italic"> AS</i> 27 (1977) 117-26; BROUZOS and STEKTORION. Coin types of Otrous and Stektorion with <i class="italic">(a)</i> a figure stepping onto a galley and <i class="italic">(b)</i> Aeneas carrying Anchises and leading Ascanius recall this tradition. B. V. Head (<i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , lxxxvi-lxxxvii), Imhoof-Blumer (<i class="italic">Nomisma</i> [1910] 33-36), von Aulock (82-83), and Carrington (124) recognized the figure stepping onto the galley as Otreus, the Phrygian king, who was also considered to be the founder of Otroia in Bithynia (Strabo 12.4-7). Supporting this identification is the fact that Otreus' companion, Mygdon, was honored at the nearby Stektorion. Babeloh's suggestion (<i class="italic">Inv. Wadd</i> . 6369-71, followed by Regling, 489-92) that the figure is Aeneas is less likely. According to Ramsay (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 686-89) the two coin types relate to the Hellenistic settlement at Otrous, the implication being that the settlers came partly from Europe, i.e., overseas, and partly from Bithynia. Furthermore, Ramsay suggests, Alexander the Macedonian (see below, note 3) was a descendant of one of these settlers. Regling suggests (489) that the Hellenistic settlers in Phrygia adopted the tradition of the Phrygian heroes known from the <i class="italic">Iliad</i> as their own. Finally, Carrington speculates (125) that the two coin types of Otrous represent an attempt by two <i class="italic">native</i> (emphasis his) cities to advertise that they were part of the Greek world. This, of course, was a common phenomenon in Roman Imperial Asia Minor. Tscherikower (35) was undecided as to whether or not Otrous was originally a Macedonian colony. Ramsay (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 687-88) said that Otrous was an Attalid colony opposing the Seleucid Brouzos. There is no evidence for this claim.</p>

But the force of this identification is weakened by the fact that at the same place an inscription containing the name Hieropolis was also found (Ramsay, <i class="italic">BCH</i> [1882] 505); R.

        <p>evidence provides only general indications of the location of Otrous but often associates it with other cities of the Pentapolis in the Sandikli plain. Pliny probably mentions Otrous immediately after Lysias (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.108; L.

        <p></p>
        <p>The tradition of claiming <b class="bold">Alexander the Great as the founder of a particular city</b> , especially under the Empire, was widespread in the Middle East. For examples from Asia Minor see Appendix II. In Roman Syria a coin of the Severan period from Gerasa has the legend A<span class="Symbol">L</span> E<span class="Symbol">X</span> (AN<span class="Symbol">D</span> PO<span class="Symbol">S</span> ) MAK(E<span class="Symbol">LW</span> N) KTI(<span class="Symbol">S</span> TH<span class="Symbol">S</span> ) <span class="Symbol">G</span> EPA<span class="Symbol">SW</span> N (H.

For an example of "Alexandrolatry" under the Severi in Europe see THESSALONIKE, note 7. With regard to the Çorhisar inscription C. P. Jones has noted in a private communication that the accusative case and the lack of the dedicator's name suggest that this was one of a series of statue bases of major city founders and benefactors (cf., for example, PERGAMON and ARSINOE Ephesos). Thus it is probable that the Alexander on the inscription was the Macedonian king; see, for example, Tscherikower (34-35; see also F. Pfister, <i class="italic">Hist</i> . 13 [1964] 65; Leschhorn, <i class="italic"> Gründer</i> , 22-22). What settlement was claiming Alexander as its founder is, as I have mentioned, not known. Ramsay believed it was Otrous. On the other hand, Drew-Bear has argued (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 115 [1991] 374-75 n. 56) that the inscription <i class="italic">(a)</i> was brought from the site of EUKARPEIA, <i class="italic">(b)</i> referred to</p>

        <p>Eukarpeia, and <i class="italic">(c)</i> commemorated the Macedonian king as the founder of that town.</p>
        <p>Another, less likely, possibility is that the person honored was a prominent citizen who claimed descent from the original Macedonian settlers. This was not unusual. The use of "Makedon" as a name, surname, or ethnic was common, especially in Asia Minor of the third century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> ; see Appendix III. Ramsay (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 702-3, followed by E Cartington, <i class="italic">AS</i> 27 [1977] 125) as well as Legrand and Chamonard (<i class="italic">BCH</i> [1893] 278) have suggested he was a local citizen. If "Alexander the Macedonian" lived at the beginning of the third century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> ., he might be identical with "Alexander the Asiarch," whose name appears on coins of Otrous from c. 200 to 215 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> .; see, for example, <i class="italic">Inv.

This renders more likely the identification of the figure on the coin as Mygdon rather than Hektor, as Regling suggested (<i class="italic">Klio</i> 8 [1908] 489-92; contra, Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">Nomisma</i> [1910] 33-36; see also Carrington, <i class="italic">AS</i> 27 [1977] 117-26; Strubbe, <i class="italic">Anc.

Ramsay suggested (685-86) that since the figure on the OTROUS coin holds no weapon in his raised right hand, this represents a peaceful emigration to Otrous. On the other hand, on the Stektorion coinage the figure has a helmet, holds a weapon with his right hand, and protects himself with a shield. According to Ramsay, this represents expulsion from overseas of the people who settled at Stektorion.

        <p>The evidence for Synnada being a Hellenistic colony is not very clear. In a confused entry Stephanos (s.v.

Clearly Stephanos has conflated a tradition about an earlier migration with one about a later Macedonian colonization.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> Like the inhabitants of other Phrygian cities, in the first to the third century,<span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> the Synnadans claimed descent from Greece.

        <p>Antigonos' general Dokimos was in command of Synnada and surrendered it to Lysimachos in 302 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> At the time there was a major royal treasure at Synnada (Diod. 20.107.3-4; Paus. 1.8.1).

        <p>Strabo remarks that the city was not very large; he also says that olive growing was practiced in the surrounding plain (12.8.14).<sup class="superscript">5</sup> The "Synnadic marble," famous in Roman times, came from quarries near Dokimeion (Strabo 12.8.14).<sup class="superscript">6</sup> It apparently got its name from the fact that under the Romans the administrative offices for the quarries were at Synnada and/or because the marble passed through Synnada on its way to Italy.

        <p>5. On Strabo's claim regarding the <b class="bold">cultivation of the olive at Synnada</b> see, for example, Ramsay, who originally dismissed the claim as a scribal error (<i class="italic">JHS</i> 8 [1887] 482) but who later was willing to consider the possibility that olive trees could have been grown there (<i class="italic">Social Basis</i> , 244-45); in general see L. Robert, <i class="italic">JS</i> (1961) 141-48.</p>
        <p>6. For the "<b class="bold">Synnadic marble</b> " and a road that, in Roman times, connected Dokimeion and Synnada, see DOKIMEION. A Synnadan coin type of late Imperial times has on it a mountain (unnamed): <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 396 no. 26; <i class="italic">Inv. Wadd</i> . 6526; Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">M. Gr</i> ., 413, no. 157; <i class="italic">Weber Coll</i> . 7186. The suggestion that this was possibly Mount Persis at Dokimeion (see, for example, B. V. Head, in <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 396, no. 26) where the quarries were located is unlikely. It would be unusual for a city to mint coins portraying a mountain (river, etc.) that was not within its territory. See also DOKIMEION for coins of that city with a representation of the mountain.</p>

         AP (Kleiner-Noe, <i class="italic">ECC</i> , 81, ser. 7 = <i class="italic">SNG</i> [von A] 8444). The suggested attribution to Aristonikos (so P. R.

Adams, <i class="italic">Hist</i> . 29 [1980] 302-11; contra, Gruen, <i class="italic">Hellenistic World</i> , 595 n. 101) is untenable. D. Kienast, <i class="italic">Hist</i> . 26 (1977) 250-52, identified BA AP with King Ariarathes V of Cappadocia; Mørkholm, <i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 24 (1979) 52-54, modified Kienast's chronology and claimed the king was Ariarathes IV because he must have given assistance to Eumenes in the latter's battle with the Gauls; Kleiner, <i class="italic">ECC</i> , 81, and <i class="italic">ANA MN</i> (1980)47, doubted "that any King Ar ... is involved with these pieces," but could offer no other solution; however, he did speculate that AP might stand for either a mint official or a city ethnic. Le Rider has recently suggested that the letters BA should be read as a monogram, 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00567.gif"></figure>
        , and that the letters

         AP (as well as <span class="Symbol">Q</span> , which he also reads) are "trois monétaires" (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 114 [1990] 691-701). Furthermore he suggested these cistophori should be attributed to BLAUNDOS. In fact this series is part of a small group of cistophori others of which have the monogram 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00569.gif"></figure>

        . They are remarkable because the three obverse dies used to produce them are also found with reverses from other mints, two Sardian and one Pergamene (Kleiner-Noe, <i class="italic">ECC</i> , 26, ser. 11b [Pergamon], and 79-81, ser. 5-8 [Sardis-Synnada]). Kleiner-Noe believed that the coins were produced at a central mint—Pergamon—in the period 160-150 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , and the monograms denoted the city in whose name the coins were issued. Noe assigned all the coins to SARDIS, while Kleiner attributed coins with 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00572.gif"></figure>
         to Sardis

         to Synnada (<i class="italic">ECC</i> , 79-81). Mørkholm, on the other hand, speculated that the first coins were struck at Pergamon for Synnada and that later a temporary mint was established at Synnada itself; he dated this to 168-166 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when the Gauls were threatening the region (<i class="italic">ANS MN</i> 24 [1979] 50-53). Le Rider preferred a date after the defeat of the Gauls in 166 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> and, on the basis of a study of the monograms, suggested reassigning not just the BA coins to Blaundos but also the coins with the monogram 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00575.gif"></figure>
         to DIONYSOPOLIS. In addition, cistophori with the monogram 
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00576.gif"></figure>
         he thought might be assigned to either Synnada, LYSIAS, or NYSA (<i class="italic">BCH</i> 114 [1990] 689-701). Of these three possibilities, Le Rider dismissed Nysa as the least likely, because it is removed geographically from Dionysopolis and Blaundos: a somewhat circular argument. But is there a delta to the left in the monogram, or is it a lambda? If it is a lambda, the coins may possibly be assigned to Lysias.

        <p>It is likely that Themisonion was a Hellenistic foundation. Nevertheless we cannot definitely identify the founder. We know of at least three persons named Themison in the Hellenistic period: a nauarch of Antigonos Monophthalmos (Diod. 19.62.7, 20.50.4; see Billows, <i class="italic">Antigonos</i> , 436), a friend and official of Antiochos II (Ath. 7.289f, 10.438d), and a friend of Antiochos III (Polyb. 5.79.12 and 82.11). Furthermore it is not possible to say whether the colony was named by the king to honor a royal favorite or whether it was founded by one of the Themisons as an independent agent.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> The only extant coins date from the early third century <span class="smallcaps">A.D</span> .<sup class="superscript">2</sup> While the location of Themisonion is not definitely known, most suggestions would place it southeast of Denizli in the Acipayamovasi, possibly at Karahüyük.<sup class="superscript">3</sup></p>
        <p><b class="bold">In general</b> see Ruge, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Themisonion"; Tscherikower, 32; Leschhorn, <i class="italic">Gründer</i> , 321-22; Mersich, <i class="italic">TIB</i> VII: 403.</p>
        <p>1. On <b class="bold">the three Themisons</b> see Schachermeyr, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.vv. "Themison 3, 4, 5." For the suggestion that the town was named for Antiochos II's minister and favorite see, for example, Droysen, <i class="italic">Hist</i> ., 2: 713; Ruge, op. cit.; Tscherikower, op. cit.; Hansen, <i class="italic">Attalids</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 175. If the town was named by the king for his minister, this may have happened when Themison was proclaimed Herakles (Ath. 7.289f-290a) and Antiochos received the name "Theos" from the Milesians (App., <i class="italic">Syr</i> .</p>

        <p>65). Berve (<i class="italic">Die Tyrannis bei den Griechen</i> [Munich, 1976] 1:426) believed Antiochos II's minister, acting as an independent dynast, founded the city. Jones (<i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 49) also pointed to its founding by a dynast but was reluctant to indicate which Themison it was. Tarn was likewise doubtful the Themison in question was the favorite of Antiochos II (<i class="italic">GBI</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 11 n. 6). Pausanias (10.32.4-5) mentions the flight of the inhabitants of Themisonion to a cave thirty stades away to avoid marauding Gauls (see Ramsay, <i class="italic">CBP</i> , 264). We do not know, however, whether he refers to the Gallic invasion of 278 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> or the later raids of the 230s <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> , when the Gauls were allied with Antiochos Hierax.</p>

        <p>3. For the general <b class="bold">location</b> of Themisonion in southwestern Phrygia see Ptol. 5.2.17; Hierokles 666.3; Pausanias (10.32.4) says it was "above Laodikeia." The <i class="italic">Tab. Peut</i> . (IX.1) places it on the road to Perge; see further, Ramsay, <i class="italic"> CBP</i> , 253 and n. 3; Ruge, 1640; Mersich, op. cit. and map at end. The placing of Themisonion at Karahüyük has been suggested by Ramsay (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 252-53, following Waddington) and is based on the following: Livy indicates (38.14.1-2) that Manlius, in his march from the Maeander valley toward Pamphylia, came to the <i class="italic">Casum amnem</i> (other MSS read <i class="italic">Cahum, Chaum, Causamenem</i> ) three days after he had left Tabai. From the river, Manlius took a day to reach Eriza, then another to get to a fort called "Thabusion" that overlooked the Indos River and was near Kibyra. Now there are extant coins of Themisonion with a river god and the legend KAZANH<span class="Symbol">S</span> on the reverse (e.g., <i class="italic">BMC Phrygia</i> , 418, no. 4; <i class="italic">Inv. Wadd</i> . 6564-65; <i class="italic"> SNG</i> [Cop] <i class="italic">Phrygia</i> 750). Ramsay suggested that the <i class="italic"> Casum amnem</i> and the Kazanes were one and the same and that they are in fact the Karahüyük Çay, the river that flows past the modern Karahüyük (accepted with reservations by Magie, <i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 1157). Robert (<i class="italic">VAM</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 112 n. 4 and 116 n. 6) would apparently search for Themisonion in the Acipayamovasi (i.e., the plain of Karahüyük) but is sceptical about the choice of Karahüuük.</p>
        <p>An inscription probably from 114 <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> found at Karahüyük records an honorific decree voted by the <i class="italic">boule</i> and <i class="italic">demos</i> and mentions, among other things, <i class="italic">strategoi</i> , a gymnasiarch, <i class="italic"> grammateus</i> , and eponymous priest (G.

The preserved section does not indicate the name of the city that passed the decree. Hansen (<i class="italic">Attalids</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 199) assumed it was Themisonion; Ramsay (<i class="italic">CBP</i> , 260) thought it "probably" was. Cousin and Diehl thought it might have been Eriza.</p>

        <p>Patara was a port on the Lycian coast (Diod. 20.93.3). According to Strabo (14.3.6), Ptolemy II Philadelphos restored (</p>

        ) Patara and renamed it Arsinoe in Lycia. The city was named for Ptolemy's wife and sister. Strabo does not provide any details about the nature of the restoration. We do not know precisely when the name change took place. Two Zenon papyri, one of c. 259 and the other from 257 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">P. Mich.

In fact, the extant evidence from abroad suggests that the latter was the case.

        <p>The existence of an Arsinoe in Pamphylia is attested by two inscriptions and is mentioned by Strabo. A Cypriot inscription, dated palaeographically to the late third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , honors a commandant of Charadros in Cilicia, Theodoros son of Demetrios, who was an "Arsinoean from Pamphylia." And an inscription on a funerary urn in Alexandreia from the year eight of an unknown king tells us the vase contained the remains of a native of Arsinoe of Pamphylia.<sup class="superscript">1</sup></p>
        <p>Pamphylia was already under Ptolemaic control in 278 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and—with interruptions—remained under Ptolemaic control until it fell to Antiochos III in 197.<sup class="superscript">2</sup> Within this time frame it is most probable that Ptolemy II Philadelphos founded Arsinoe. Arsinoe was located very near a region that was an important source of shipbuilding timber later exploited by Cleopatra VII (Strabo 14.5.3). It is quite likely, therefore, that Philadelphos founded Arsinoe in connection with his naval program.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> The precise location has not yet been discovered. Strabo says that after Korakesion (the modern Alanya) there was a polis named Arsinoe (14.5.3): </p>

        <p>Prior to the discovery of the epigraphic evidence for Arsinoe in Pamphylia it was argued that the Arsinoe near Korakesion in Strabo 14.5.3 was an error and that the text should be emended to either Syedra (Ruge, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Syedra") or Aunesis (Müller, in <i class="italic">GGM</i> , 1: 487-88); contra now, Bean and Mitford, <i class="italic">AS</i> (1962) 196 n. 22; Robert, <i class="italic">EEP</i> , 255 n. 2. It is possible that this Arsinoe or Arsinoe in Cilicia is referred to in <i class="italic">P. Mich. Zen</i> . 10.5 and 13; see ARSINOE Patara.</p>
        <p>2. The situation of Pamphylia in the third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> was, as Meyer has remarked, "etwas unklar" (<i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 137). Ptolemy H Philadelphos appointed a Pamphyli[arch] over the region in 278 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (L. Robert, <i class="italic">DocAMM</i> , 53-58; J. and L. Robert <i class="italic">BE</i> [1967] 601), and Theocritus (17.88) listed Pamphylia among Philadelphos' possessions. What is not clear is how extensive his rule was or how long it lasted. According to the Adoulis inscription (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 54.14) Ptolemy III</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_336" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">336</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_336"></div>
        <p>Euergetes I claimed Pamphylia as his conquest. When Philadelphos lost control of Pamphylia is not clear. Presumably this happened during the Second Syrian War, i.e., before 253 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Antiochos II probably then controlled Pamphylia until he lost it to Euergetes I, undoubtedly during the Third Syrian War (246-241 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ). The Ptolemies again lost most of Pamphylia two decades later. H. Seyrig called attention to four series of posthumous Alexanders from Perge, Aspendos, Sillyon, and Phaseils, which are dated by an era (Phaselis and Perge, years 1-33; Aspendos, years 1-31; Sillyon, years 3-11) that, according to Seyrig, probably began in 221 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Then Seyrig suggested that these cities freed themselves shortly after Euergetes' death in 221 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">RN</i> [1963] 38-51; on the other hand, Boehringer [<i class="italic">Zur Chronologie</i> , 52-62] claimed that we are dealing not with a common "Pamphylian Era" but rather with eras starting at different years for each city, i.e., 219 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> for Perge and Sillyon, 218 for Phaselis, 210 for Aspendos; however, the discovery of an obverse die link between the coinage of Perge and Aspendos disproves Boehringer's suggestion; see Mørkholm, <i class="italic">EHC</i> , 143). Finally, in 218 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Achaios overran most of Pamphylia (Polyb. 5.77.1), and this effectively ended Ptolemaic rule over most of the region. On the shifting pattern of Ptolemaic and Seleucid control over Pamphylia see Huss, <i class="italic"> Aussen</i> ., 190-91; Bagnall, <i class="italic">Ptol. Poss</i> ., 110-14; Meyer, <i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 44-45, 137; and SELEUKEIA in Pamphylia. The two possibilities for the <b class="bold">founder</b> of Arsinoe in Pamphylia are Ptolemy II and III. Of these Philadelphos is the far more likely candidate. He was, of course, married to Arsinoe II and named numerous other colonies for her. Furthermore he was especially active founding colonies on the south coast of Asia Minor.</p>
        <p>3 For <b class="bold">Philadelphos' shipbuilding activities in Cyprus</b> see ARSINOE Marion.</p>
        <p>4. Previously it was suggested that <b class="bold">Strabo's account</b> was confused and that Korakesion itself might have been refounded as an Arsinoe (Jones, <i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 199, followed by Bean and Mitford, <i class="italic">AS</i> 12 [1962] 195-96; see also J. and L. Robert, <i class="italic">BE</i> [1965] 421, and <i class="italic">Amyzon</i> , 157 n. 8). In addition, Jones suggested that ARSINOE in Cilicia and Nagidos, which Strabo distinguished (14.5.3), were also identical (<i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 199). However, the publication in 1989 of an inscription of the later third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> from Arsinoe in Cilicia clearly showed the two cities coexisting (E. Kirsten and I. Opelt, <i class="italic">ZPE</i> 77 [1989] 55-66, esp. 61-62; C. E Jones and G. Habicht, <i class="italic">Phoenix</i> 43 [1989] 317-46, esp. 333-34). This renders less likely the view that Arsinoe in Pamphylia and Korakesion were identical (<i class="italic">nota bene</i> that in i938 L. Robert suggested that Arsinoe in Pamphylia was located a little to the east of Korakesion, <i class="italic">EEP</i> , 255 n. 2). The problem of Hamaxia, which Strabo (14-5.3) says was east and which the <i class="italic">Stadiasmus</i> (208) says was west of Korakesion, remains unresolved; J. and L.

         (14.4) The passage is obscure and has been the subject of much discussion.<sup class="superscript">l</sup> Apparently it means that at the same time Attalos II founded Attaleia he also sent a colony to Korykos and surrounded Korykos with a larger circuit wall. While the precise date of the founding is union, two possibilities emerge: 189 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , when Attalos marched with Cn.

Leake (<i class="italic">Asia Minor</i> , 192), Hirschfeld (loc. cit.), Tscherikower (loc. cit.), and Radet (<i class="italic">RA</i> [1890] 218) understood Strabo to mean that Attalos established the new foundation next to Korykos and then surrounded <i class="italic">both</i> towns with a larger wall. Petersen (in <i class="italic">Städte Pamphyliens und Pisidiens</i> , 1:14 and n. 3) rejected Strabo's use of </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00589.gif"></figure>
         to describe the relative location of Korykos to Attaleia and suggested that there was no Korykos in Pamphylia; see also Ruge, <i class="italic">RE</i> s.vv. "Korykos 3" and "Attaleia 3," as well as Magie, 1133. The problem is that there were a number of localities called Korykos on the southern Asia Minor coast. There was a Korykos in Lycia (Strabo 14.3.8, 5.7; <i class="italic">Stadiasmus</i> , 227-28 [<i class="italic">GGM</i> , 1: 490]; O. Benndorf, in <i class="italic">Festschift Otto Hirschfeld</i> [Berlin, 1903] 83 n. 2) and a more famous one in Cilicia (Strabo 14.5.5; see also <i class="italic"> MAMA</i> II, pp. 90-93; A. Machatschek, <i class="italic">DAWW</i> 96 [1967] 13); on the confusion between the two see Magie, 1168 and references; also Ormerod, <i class="italic">JRS</i> 12 (1922) 42-44.
        <p></p>
        <p>The evidence for a Korykos in Pamphylia is equivocal. Stephanos (s.v. "Attaleia") said Attalos Philadelphos folded Attaleia but mistakenly transferred Attaleia to the <i class="italic">Cilician</i> Korykos. The Suda (s.v. "Korykaios") placed Korykos</p>
        <div id="JD_Page_338" class="page-break-container">
          <div class="page-number">338</div>
          <hr id="JD_Page_338"></div>
        <p>in Pamphylia, said it was the site of Attaleia, and added that it was on a promontory. This is embarrassing because while Cilician Korykos—according to Strabo 14.5.5—was built on a promontory, Attaleia in Pamphylia was not. Dionysios Periegetes mentions a Korykos in Pamphylia along with Perge and Phaselis (855; = <i class="italic">GGM</i> , 2:156; cf. Nikephoros <i class="italic">Geog. Synop</i> . 847-77 = <i class="italic">GGM</i> , 2: 465); but, as Ormerod notes, "if Attaleia is intended, it is badly misplaced" (<i class="italic">JRS</i> [1922] 43 n. 1). The only other evidence for a Pamphylian Korykos is Strabo's use of the term </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00590.gif"></figure>
         (14.4.1). If he is accurate in his usage, then we must conclude that Attalos simultaneously built two adjacent colonies. This is unlikely. The normal practice in such situations was to establish a foundation at a site adjacent to a native town, not to colonize simultaneously the native town as well. If, however, Strabo used the term mistakenly or rather loosely, then we may follow Petersen's suggestion, deny the existence of a Pamphylian Korykos and posit two separate Pergamene colonies, one in Lycia and one in Pamphylia.
        <p></p>
        <p>2. Petersen and von Luschan (<i class="italic">Reisen in südwestlichen Kleinasien</i> , vol. 2, <i class="italic">Reisen in Lykien, Milyas und Kibyratis</i> [Vienna, 1889] 178) suggested that Attalos founded Attaleia when he took part in the expedition of Manlius. But Magie rightly objected (1133) that <i class="italic">(a)</i> there is no evidence Manlius entered the Pamphylian plain and <i class="italic">(b)</i> it is unlikely that Attalos would have named a foundation after himself during the reign of his brother, Eumenes. Hopp (<i class="italic">Unter</i> ., 103-4) prefers the later date, though he allows that Attalos might have discovered the site in 189.

        <p>3. The similarity of cults at Attaleia and Pergamon led Petersen to suggest (in <i class="italic">Stüdte Pamphyliens und Pisidiens</i> , 15, followed by Hansen, <i class="italic">Attalids</i>

        <p>2. Regarding <b class="bold">a possible founder</b> , Tscherikower (37) prefers Ptolemy II; Huss (<i class="italic">Aussen</i> ., 191) does not commit himself but does not favor Ptolemy IV.</p>
        <p>3. There is a series of coins with the head of Apollo on the obverse and an amphora (occasionally with an eagle) and the legend <span class="Symbol">P</span> TO<span class="Symbol">L</span> E or <span class="Symbol">P</span> TO<span class="Symbol">L</span> EMAIE<span class="Symbol">W</span> N on the reverse; for examples see PTOLEMAIS Lebedos, note 2. These coins have been conjecturally attributed to various cities. Thus, J. Friedländer grouped them with Ptolemais in Pamphylia (<i class="italic">NZ</i> 2 [1870] 346-48 and <i class="italic"> ZfN</i> 6 [1879] 239-41; see also Dieudonné's discussion, <i class="italic">JIAN</i> 5 [1902] 50). However, the attribution is very uncertain. Hill, for instance, rejected it outright, preferring a city in the central or southern coast of western Asia Minor (<i class="italic">BMC Parnphylia</i> , lxxx). Other possible attributions are PTOLEMAIS in Caria and PTOLEMAIS Larisa. See further discussion and references in PTOLEMAIS Lebedos and especially Robert, <i class="italic">BCH</i> (1946) 516-19. The Ptolemais coins that Imhoof-Blumer listed under Pamphylia in <i class="italic">Gr.

Second, he and Nollé pointed out that the <i class="italic">Stadiasmus</i> is a handbook for sailors. It describes the coast line and anchorages and the distances between various points. They discount the possibility that a site so far inland as Sihlar<a name="d0e31511-ref" href="#d0e31511" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          could have been recorded in the <i class="italic">Stadiasmus</i> . Furthermore Nollé pointed out that the Melas (Manavgat) River is navigable only as far as the town of Manavgat. Hence both scholars follow the <i class="italic">Stadiasmus</i> and suggest that Seleukeia was on the coast, halfway between Side and the mouth of the Eurymedon River.<sup class="superscript">7</sup></p>

        <p>For a brief survey of what is known about Ptolemaic and Seleucid rule in Pamphylia during the third century <span class="smallcaps"> B.C.</span> see ARSINOE in Pamphylia. According to Theocritus (17.88) Pamphylia was a possession of Ptolemy II Philadelphos; according to the Adoulis inscription (<i class="italic">OGIS</i> 54.14) Ptolemy III Euergetes I conquered it. Philadelphos probably lost Pamphylia during the Second Syrian War</p>

        <p>(260-253 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ), and Euergetes I probably regained it during the Third Syrian War (246-241 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ). What is not clear is how much territory in Pamphylia Philadelphos controlled, what he lost, and what territories Euergetes I actually controlled. Nevertheless <b class="bold"> it is likely that Antiochos I founded Seleukeia</b> and named it for his father (see Tscherikower [175] and Meyer [<i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 44], who speculates that Antiochos founded it to counter the Ptolemaic Aspendos). A founding date for Seleukeia after the Third Syrian War is unlikely. The chaos and civil wars brought on by Hierax and Achaios reduced Seleucid control in western and central Asia Minor and brought to an end the great age of settlement foundings. In Pamphylia, Achaios seized control from Ptolemy IV Philopator in 218 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Polyb. 5.77.1). When Antiochos III came into possession of the area is not dear. Schmitt suggests he wrested Achaios' Pamphylian territory in the period 216-213 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (<i class="italic">Antiochos</i> , 279); Seyrig assumes he took it over after the final defeat of Achaios in 213 (<i class="italic">RN</i> [1963] 41). In any event, both Livy (33.19.11, 20.4-5) and Hieronymus (<i class="italic">In Dan</i> . 11.15-16 = <i class="italic">FGrH</i> 260 F46) mention Antiochos' conquests in 197 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> along the Lycian and Cilician coast but omit any reference to Pamphylia; see above, p. 335 and note 2; Huss, <i class="italic">Aussen</i> ., 190-91; Schmitt, <i class="italic">Antiochos</i> , 182f., 279; Meyer, <i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 44-45, 137; and ARSINOE in Pamphylia.

        <p>2. According to the <i class="italic">Stadiasmus</i> 216-17 (=<i class="italic">GGM</i> , 1: 488-89) the distance from Side to Seleukeia was eighty stades, from Seleukeia to the Eurymedon, one hundred stades. The <b class="bold"> identification of the site near Sihlar</b>

It is unlikely that an Antigonid or Seleucid colonist of the late fourth/early third century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> would have set up a bilingual inscription. There were, of course, Greeks in the East who were bilingual. For example, Diodorus (17.110.4-5) mentions the case of a colony of Boeotians living east of the Tigris River in Sittakene. They had been brought (exiled? cf. Hdt. 6.119 and above, p. 16) to their dwelling place by Xerxes. A century and a half later they spoke

The discovery by Dörtlük (17-18; map and photographs, 19-23) of bronze coins of the city of the Keraeitai near the village of Belören (8 km north of Bucak) provided firm evidence for its location.

J.A.

Schmitz (Smith, <i class="italic">Dict. Geog</i> . s.v. "Laodiceia Combusta") followed Hamilton's assertion and suggested the town was at some time destroyed by fire and given the epithet when it was rebuilt! Kiepert (<i class="italic">FOA</i> VIII, p. 14a) thought the name was derived from smelting furnaces supposed to have been located at the town (followed by Ruge, op. cit.; von Aulock <i class="italic">MSLyk</i> ., 45).

        <p>Seleukeia in northern Pisidia is known by three different names. The name Seleukeia is used by Ptolemy (5.5.4); it is also found in the epigraphic evidence and on some coins that have been tentatively ascribed to late Hellenistic Seleukeia. In the first century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> , presumably as a result of Claudius' organization of the province of Lycia-Pamphylia in 43 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> , its name was changed to Claudioseleuceia.

Subsequently the name "Seleukeia" reappeared in Byzantine lists, often with the epithet "Sidera."<sup class="superscript">1</sup></p>

        <p></p>
        <p>2. The Seleucid hold on Pisidia was weak and of relatively short duration. As a result of his victory over Lysimachos at Korupedion in 281 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Seleukos I came into possession of this region. It is, however, unlikely that he founded any colonies in Pisidia in the short time between the battle and his own death some months later. Whatever Seleucid colonizing activity there was in the area was probably undertaken by Antiochos I or II. After the death of the latter, the rebellious activities of Antiochos Hierax and, later, Achaios weakened the already feeble Seleucid hold on Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains. Achaios was active plundering in Pisidia (Polyb. 5.57.7) and in 218 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> captured the region of Milyas (Polyb. 5.72.3f., 77.1; on Milyas see A. S. Hall, <i class="italic">AS</i> 36 [1986] 137-57; and APOLLONIA in Phrygia). It is doubtful that Antiochos III, despite some military activity there in 193 (Livy 35.13.5, 15.7; App. <i class="italic">Syr</i> . 9) was able to reassert Seleucid control (see Schmitt, <i class="italic">Antiochos</i> , 279).</p>
        <p>Both Tscherikower (175) and Meyer (<i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 129) suggest Antiochos I as the <b class="bold">founder</b> . Considering his activity establishing colonies elsewhere in Asia Minor and the fact that he named Apameia in Phrygia for his mother, it is possible that he founded Seleukeia in Pisidia and named it for his father.</p>

He also noted that the village of Agras (the modern Atabey), approximately 4 km north of Selef, was the ancient Agrai, which is often combined with Seleukeia in the Byzantine lists (e.g., <i class="italic">Not.

        <p>Aigeai, which Strabo (14.5.18) described as a small town with an anchorage, claimed to be a Macedonian foundation.<sup class="superscript">1</sup> It also claimed Alexander the Great as its founder. A late redaction of the Alexander Romance contains a fictitious letter of Alexander to his mother, Olympias, and Aristotle concerning the battle of Issos: "I thought it necessary to write to you about the battle that took place against Darius. Having heard that he was around the Gulf of Issos with many kings and satraps, I collected many goats, bound torches on their horns, and led them out into the night. When they (i.e., the Persians) saw us, they turned to flee, thinking our army was large. And so I victoriously put them to flight. For this reason I founded a city that I called Aigai, and on the Gulf of Issos I founded a city, Alexandreia on the Issos."<sup class="superscript">2</sup> A coin type of Aigeai of the early third century <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span> bears the picture of a goat with torches attached to its horns.<sup class="superscript">3</sup> A coin of Aigeai dated to 215/6 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> bears the legend MAKE<span class="Symbol">D</span> ONIKH<span class="Symbol">S</span>

It is interesting to note that in <i class="italic">I. Cilicie</i> 68 Antioch honored Hermokrates son of Demeas. It is probably this Hermokrates whose son, Demeas, was later honored by Mallos (<i class="italic">I. Cilicie</i> 69). On the problem of the Pyramos River, which probably has changed its course since antiquity, see Magie, op. cit. It was once thought that Karatas<a name="d0e33547-ref" href="#d0e33547" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          was the site of the ancient Mallos (so, for example, Ramsay, <i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 385; Waddington, in LW III, p. 351). The conclusion followed that Antioch was simply the renamed Mallos. In fact the <i class="italic">Stadiasmus</i> distinguishes Antioch from Mallos, which it says was 150 stades from it. As a result, Imhoof-Blumer argued conclusively (93-95, followed by Heberdey and Wilhelm, 9; Magie, 1149; Robert, <i class="italic">CRAI</i> [1951] 257) that Karatas<a name="d0e33559-ref" href="#d0e33559" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          was the site of Magarsos and that Mallos was located inland on the banks of the Pyramos (on Mallos see Hild and Hellenkemper, <i class="italic">TIB</i> V.1: 337-38; photographs, pls. 279-82, and map in vol. 2).

        <p>3. One of the inscriptions (Heberdey and Wilhelm, <i class="italic">DAWW</i> 44: no. 66 = <i class="italic">OGIS</i> 754) indicates that <b class="bold">Hierapolis was the center of an area called Castabalis.</b> Two inscriptions (Bent and Hicks, nos. 16 and 17 [= Heberdey and Wilhelm, no. 59], on which see Robert, 33-36) record the existence of a cult of "Thea Pera-sia." Strabo twice (12.1.4 and 2.7) records a Castabala that had a cult of Artemis Perasia; however, he locates this Castabala in Cappadocia. It is not possible to conclude whether Strabo has erred or whether there were in fact two Castabalas, one in Cappadocia and one in Cilicia (as Pliny indicates, <i class="italic">NH</i> 5.93 and 6.8). See, for example, E. L. Hicks, <i class="italic">JHS</i> 11 (1890) 243-45 (two cities of the same name; also Magie, 1151). Stephen Mitchell, in a private communication, suggests that the "Cappadocian" Castabala was one and the same with the Cilician Castabala. He notes that the latter, being out in the plain, was virtually in Cappadocia. For full discussion and references see Imhoof-Blumer (279ff.), Magie (1151), and Robert (36-38).</p>

        <p>1. There are three candidates for <b class="bold">founder</b> of Philadelpheia: Ptolemy II Philadelphos, Attalos II Philadelphos, and Antiochos IV of Commagene. Meyer (<i class="italic">Die Grenzen</i> , 43) believed the Egyptian king established it. Tscherikower objected (39-40) that the probable location of it is too far inland to have been Ptolemaic (see also L. Robert, <i class="italic">REA</i> [1934] 522). However, the recent discovery of what was apparently a Ptolemaic garrison at Meydancikkale, 8 km southeast of Gülnar in ancient Rough Cilicia may be noted (Davesne and Le Rider, <i class="italic"> Meydancikkale</i> ). A dedication to Hermes and Herakles on behalf of Ptolemy III, Berenike II, and their children and the evidence of the extraordinary coin hoard found at the site (<i class="italic">Meydancikkale</i> , 343-48 and passim) allow us to date the garrison to c. 245-235 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Precisely when it was founded we do not know. Nevertheless the presence of a garrison on the northern frontier of Ptolemaic Rough Cilicia raises the possibility that Philadelpheia, despite its probable location in the interior of Cilicia, was likewise a Ptolemaic foundation.</p>
        <p>Tscherikower also dismissed the possibility that k was a foundation of Attalos II on the grounds that the Attalids never controlled Cilicia. He and Robert both followed Ramsay's suggestion (<i class="italic">HGAM</i> , 372-73 and <i class="italic">RN</i> [1894] 169-71) that in the early first century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> Antiochos IV of Commagene founded it and named it after his wife, Iotape Philadelphos (see also Jones, <i class="italic">CERP</i>

        <p>1. According to Pliny (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.93) Seleukeia was founded when the coastal city of Hermia (= Stephanos' Hyria) was moved to the new, inland site. According to Strabo (14.5.4, followed by Stephanos s.v. "Holmoi") the new city was formed when the inhabitants of Holmoi migrated there. Finally, Stephanos says (s.v. "Seleukeia" and "Hyria") that Seleukeia was previously called Olbia and Hyria. All this suggests, as Tscherikower (39) has theorized, that the new foundation resulted from a synoecism. For archaeological evidence of previous Hellenistic habitation at the site of Seleukeia see E. Gjerstad, <i class="italic">RA</i> (1934) 157.</p>
        <p>Evidence for early Seleucid colonizing activity in Cilicia can be seen at Seleukeia on the Kalykadnos, ANTIOCH on the Kydnos, and, probably, at ANTIOCH on the Pyramos. Is it possible that, in a manner similar to what he did in the region of Seleukis in northern Syria, Nikator was trying to anchor the Seleucid presence in Cilicia with these (and other) colonies?</p>

Mørkholm (<i class="italic">Antiochus IV</i> , 117) is correctly sceptical about identifying the founder. He points out that for SELEUKEIA on the Pyramos, ANTIOCH on the Saros, and HIERAPOLIS Castabala "the evidence for Antiochus IV's activity consists in the simple fact that the new dynastic name first appears on municipal coins struck during has reign .... The first appearance of a new city name can only give us the <i class="italic">terminus ante quem</i> of the foundation ... and not the exact date of that event."

A further indication of Ariarathes IV's active involvement in the larger Hellenistic world and of his imitation of its fashions is the probability that the first Cappadocian silver coinage was struck at the royal Seleucid mint in Soloi during the reign of his ally and brother-in-law, Antiochos IV Epiphanes (Mørkholm, <i class="italic">NC</i> [1969] 24-25; contra, B. Simonetta, <i class="italic">QT</i> [1973] 37-42). Tscherikower (43) hesitated between Ariarathes IV and the great philhellene Ariarathes V (on whom see Eusebeia near Argaios) but opted for the latter on the analogy with EUSEBEIA near Argaios and the Tauros, both of which he probably founded. Jones (<i class="italic">CERP</i>
        <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 174, 430) suggested the founder was Ariarathes III, who was married to the daughter of the Seleucid Antiochos II. Jones notes that the Stephanos passage allows us to identify the founder as either Ariarathes III or IV (both of whom were sons-in-law of an Antiochos) but opts for the former because "the founder of the dynasty is more likely" (430). H. Groethe (<i class="italic">Meine Vorderasienexpedition 1906 und 1907</i> [1912] 2: 28) preferred Ariarathes I. This is not likely. In general see L.

Droysen suggested that Kressa was identical with Krateia (the later Flaviopolis) in Paphlagonia. Following upon this, Jones cited the mention of the Thracian names Seuthes and Ziailis in an inscription from Krateia (<i class="italic">CIG</i> 3808) as evidence that Kressa had been a Bithynian colony.

        <p>1. Strabo does not mention Laodikeia; he does, however, refer both to Kizari, a fortress on the shores of Lake Stephane that he describes as deserted, and to a nearby ruined palace (12.3.38). It is quite likely that Kizari is to be identified with a ruined fortress located on a limestone bluff that rises behind Lâdik. Furthermore, it is possible that Laodikeia was a Hellenistic refounding that consisted of both the fortress and the palace. The destruction of the town may have occurred during the Third Mithridatic War; this might explain Strabo's use of the old, rather than the Hellenistic, name. Interestingly, it is the Hellenistic name that ultimately survived. See further, Anderson, op. cit.; Olshausen and Biller, op. cit.</p>

Wilson suggested (op. cit., 248) that the Pharnakeians assumed the name of Kerasous in order "to identify themselves with the earlier colony." In this connection Wilson noted that the population of Pharnakeia included settlers from Kotyora, which was itselfa colony of Sinope. On the other hand, it may simply be, as Wilson also noted, that Kerasous was in fact an earlier name of Pharnakeia (see the statement in Arrian cited above).</p>

        <p>Stephanos records an Antigoneia (s.v. no. 4) near Daskyleion in Bithynia. This is the only reference to it. From the name we may suggest that it was founded by Antigonos Monophthalmos. The location is not definitely known and has been the subject of much discussion.</p>
        <p>There were two cities named Daskyleion in the Hellespontine region. The first was in western Bithynia, approximately twelve kilometers east of the mouth of the Rhyndakos River, probably located at the modern Eskel<a name="d0e36504-ref" href="#d0e36504" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          Limam on the coast of the Propontis. Until the early part of this century the site had still been known to the Greeks as Daskeli. This is the Daskyleion that Stephanos (s.v. no. 4) refers to as </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00694.gif"></figure>
        . It is most probably the one that was in the vicinity of Antigoneia.<sup class="superscript">1</sup>
        <p></p>
        <p>The other Daskyleion was in Hellespontine Phrygia on the southeast corner of the Kus<a name="d0e36513-ref" href="#d0e36513" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          (Manyas) Gölü (the ancient Aphnitis, south of Kyzikos) close to Erigli at Hisartepe. It had been a Persian satrapal residence and is probably the Daskyleion that Stephanos (s.v. no. 5) refers to as </p>

          Limani. He also suggested that the latter was its harbor.</p>

        <p>Wehrli (<i class="italic">Antig</i> ., 83) and Billows (<i class="italic">Antigonos</i> , 297) connect Antigoneia with the Daskyleion that had been a satrapal residence, i.e., with Hisartepe. This is unlikely, however, because it would place Antigoneia in Hellespontine Phrygia rather than in Bithynia.</p>

        <p>Corsten (59-61; see also Magie, <i class="italic">RRAM</i> , 971, and Tscherikower, 49), has suggested that Antigoneia near Daskyleion might have been identical with NIKAIA. Both Strabo (12.4.7) and Stephanos (s.v. "Nikaia") indicate that Nikaia was previously founded as an Antigoneia. Strabo adds that it was colonized by Antigonos Monophthalmos. Neither, however, connect this city with Antigoneia near Daskyleion. Furthermore Nikaia could hardly be described as near (</p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00696.gif"></figure>
        ) Daskyleion. (See also the early suggestion of Hasluck, <i class="italic">Cyzicus</i> , 58, that Daskyleion was at the site of the modern Bursa [= Prousa]—thus the appropriateness of describing Nikaia as "near" Daskyleion. However, the siting of the towns of Daskyleion at [or very close to] Eskel<a name="d0e36615-ref" href="#d0e36615" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
        Limani and near Erigli effectively nullifies this proposal.)
        <p></p>
        <p>Stephanos distinguishes Antigoneia near Daskyleion from ANTIGONEIA "a phrourion of the Kyzikene, fifty stades from the Western Sea." A decree of Eretria honors three Antigoneians who were friends of Demetrios Poliorketes (<i class="italic">Syll</i> .<sup class="superscript">3</sup> 348). Unfortunately there is no indication which Antigoneia this was. Diodorus (20.111.3) says that in 302 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Demetrios campaigned in the Hellespont and recovered a number of cities, among them Lampsakos and Parion. Thus if Antigonos did found Antigoneia near Daskyleion, it is possible that the persons honored in the Eretrian decree came from this city. See further ALEXANDREIA Troas.</p>

         of Philip V; he does not, however, specify the relationship. In fact we do not know the name or the origin of Prousias I's wife. On the other hand, Stephanos (s.vv. "Apameia" and "Myrleia") attributes the founding to Prousias' grandson, Nikomedes II Epiphanes. Stephanos adds that Nikomedes named it for his mother, Apama. An inscription from Asia Minor found in the Piraeus confirms that Nikomedes' mother was named Apama (<i class="italic">IG</i> II-III<sup class="superscript">2</sup> 3172 = <i class="italic">I. Apameia</i> , 89 T12; see Wilhelm, 75-82). While we cannot be certain, it would appear from the superior authority of Strabo and the fact that Prousias I renamed the nearby Kios after himself under circumstances similar to that of Apameia that he was also the founder of Apameia.

Jones (<i class="italic">CERP</i>
          <sup class="superscript">2</sup> , 36-37 and n. 15) suggested Apollonia was an old Milesian colony that was renamed by the Attalids. See also A.

Note, however, L.

        <p>From Stephanos (s.v. "Nikaia") and Strabo (12.4.7) we learn that Nikaia was originally called Angkore, refounded as Antigoneia by Antigonos Monophthalmos and then renamed Nikaia by Lysimachos for his wife.

The Antigoneians mentioned in an Eretrian decree (<i class="italic">Syll</i> .<sup class="superscript">3</sup> 348) who were friends of Demetrios Poliorketes may have come from this city. However, the fact that Demetrios was operating in the Hellespont in 302 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Diod. 20.111.3) suggests the persons honored were probably from ANTIGONEIA in Mysia or near Daskyleion; see also ALEXANDREIA Troas.</p>
        <p>On the problem surrounding the <b class="bold">founding date</b> see Tscherikower, 47 n. 185; Ruge, 228. We may attempt to reconstruct the chronological sequence as follows: Lysimachos first came into possesssion of Antigoneia Nikaia after the battle of Ipsos in 301 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> By that time, according to Diodorus (20.109.6-7), he had married Amastris, whom he was soon to divorce in favor of Arsinoe (Memnon, <i class="italic">FGrH</i> 434 F4.9). Assuming Lysimachos did not divorce Nikaia in order to marry Amastris, it may be suggested that Nikaia died in 302 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> and that Lysimachos refounded Antigoneia in her memory soon after Ipsos.</p>
        <p>2. Regarding the tradition about a <b class="bold">Macedonian origin</b> , Stephanos (s.v.) says that Nikaia was a colony of Bottiaia, which was in Macedonia. Memnon adds (<i class="italic">FGrH</i> 434 F28.9-10, on which see Jacoby's commentary) that soldiers from Nikaia in Locris near Phocis who were fighting with Alexander founded it. Presumably this tradition explains the appearance of Alexander on some coins of Imperial Nikaia (e.g., <i class="italic">BMC Pontus</i> , 159, no. 47; Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">Kl.M</i> ., 9, no. 3, and citations there). It is unlikely, however, that veterans of Alexander—who was never in this region—founded a colony here. But it is possible, as Tscherikower suggests (47; see also Ruge, 229), that these Bottiaians were veterans of Antigonos' army. In any event Dio Chrysostom (<i class="italic">Or</i> . 39.1) refers specifically to the Greek and Macedonian composition of its population. Pliny's statement (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.148) that Nikaia was formerly called Olbia is wrong; see NIKOMEDEIA.</p>
        <p>3. <b class="bold">Dionysos and Herakles</b> each appear on some Nikaian coins (first-second century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> ) as <i class="italic">ktistes</i> (e.g., Waddington et al., <i class="italic">Recueil</i> , 1: 403ff., nos. 44, 54-55, 219 [Dionysos], 56-58, 108 [Herakles; cf. Dio Chrys. 39.8: "Herakles the <i class="italic">ktistes</i> of the city"]). Occasionally Dionysos and the nymph Nikaia are associated as <i class="italic"> ktistai</i> (e.g., Waddington et al., <i class="italic">Recueil</i> , 1: 503, no. 819; Robert, <i class="italic">HSCP</i> [1977] 15).

        <p>4. The <b class="bold">suggestion that Nikaia was under Bithynian control by 280</b>
          <b class="bold">B.C</b> . <b class="bold">and probably earlier</b> , at the outbreak of the war with Lysimachos, is based on a sepulchral epigram found at Bazarköy opposite Nikaia on the western shore of Iznik<a name="d0e37543-ref" href="#d0e37543" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          Gölü.

Mela 1.100, on which see note 3). While Strabo (11.4.2) also distinguished Nikomedeia from Astakos, Pausanias (5.12.7) thought the former resulted simply from a renaming of the latter; see Tscherikower, 45-46; Leschhorn, 269-70.

        <p>3. The <b class="bold">relation of Olbia to Nikomedeia</b> (or some other town in the area) is not dear. Olbia was a coastal city (Scylax 92; <i class="italic">GGM</i> , 1: 67) after which the Astakene Gulf was occasionally called the Olbian (Pomp. Mela 1.100). Drawing on Arrian as his source, Stephanos says that Nikomedeia was also called Olbia (s.w. "Nikomedeia" and "Asstakos"). Relying on the superior authority of Arrian, Tscherikower <i class="italic">(a)</i> suggested that Nikomedeia resulted from a synoecism of Olbia and Astakos and <i class="italic">(b)</i> rejected Pliny's claim (<i class="italic">NH</i> 5.148) that Nikaia had formerly been known as Olbia (45-46). Ruge (<i class="italic">RE</i> s.w. "Nikaia 7," 229, and "Olbia 1") also rejected Pliny's identification. Furthermore, after initially suggesting that Olbia and Astakos were identical (<i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Astakos 2"), he later (<i class="italic">RE</i> s.v. "Olbia 1") expressed great doubts about the equation. The authors of the <i class="italic"> ATL</i> (1: 472) also separated the two and placed Olbia on the south coast of the Gulf of Izmit<a name="d0e37833-ref" href="#d0e37833" data-tei-tag="ref">*</a>
          , southwest of Astakos; see also Vitucci, 27 and n. 6. There is no reason to believe with Sölch (146) that Kalchedonians were among the founding population of Nikomedeia (contra, Ruge, s.v. "Nikomedeia," 471).</p>

        . For Croesus, Stephanos (s.v. "Prousa") substituted Cyrus. Since no such Prousias is known in the sixth or fifth century, these passages have been treated with scepticism or subjected to unconvincing emendations. For example, A. Körte (<i class="italic">AM</i> 24 [1899] 412 n. 1) has suggested there was a half-mythical founder who considerably predated Prousias I. This position has met with little acceptance; see, for example, G. Mendel, <i class="italic">BCH</i> 24 (1900) 363 n. 2; Tscherikower, 48-49; Holleaux, <i class="italic">Ét</i> ., 2: 114 n. 4; L.

           Settlements in Asia Minor Attributed to Alexander</a></h2>
      <p>The thirteen settlements in Asia Minor listed below have been attributed, in antiquity or by modern scholars, to Alexander the Great. Consult the appropriate entries for further discussion and references.</p>
      <q class="blockquote">
        <p>AIGEAI. The evidence for Alexander being the founder of Aigeai is found only in a late redaction of the Alexander Romance. A letter in the Romance, purportedly written by the Macedonian king to his mother, relates how he founded Aigeai after the battle of Issos. The letter includes a description of how he used goats with torches on their horns to frighten the Persians into thinking the Macedonian army was large. In fact a coin type of Aigeai of the early third century <span class="smallcaps"> A.D.</span> ). has a picture of a goat with torches attached to its horns. This does not seem to me to be sufficient evidence to claim Alexander as the founder of the settlement.</p>
      </q><q class="blockquote">
        <p>ALEXANDREIA BY LATMOS. This is a particularly difficult city to discuss. Not only do we not know who founded it, we do not know its location. In fact two possibilities (Alinda and Herakleia by Latmos) have been sugggested as its location, and four different persons (the Carian queen Ada, Alexander, Lysimachos, and Antigonos Monophthalmos) have been proffered as the founder. There is no ancient evidence that names Alexander as the founder. Rather it is a modern theory.</p>
      </q><q class="blockquote">
        <p>ALEXANDREIA Troas. W. W. Tarn contends that Alexander founded this city. His claim is based on two points: <i class="italic"> (a)</i> Appian's reference to Alexandreia </p>
        <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00762.gif"></figure>
         (<i class="italic">Syr</i> . 29) should be translated "of the Granikos" and means that Alexander intended to build a city at the site of the later Alexandreia, just as he promised to rebuild Ilion. However, Tarn does admit that the promise for Alexandreia is unrecorded. <i class="italic">(b)</i> A late tradition, recorded by

        <hr id="JD_Page_421"></div>
      <q class="blockquote">
        <p>Stephanos ("Alexandreia 2") and pseudo-Callisthenes, says that Alexander founded Alexandreia Troas. Both these sources are weak and suspect. Stephanos' errors and confusions make him a weak primary source without other, corroborating evidence. In this case the corroborating evidence is pseudo-Callisthenes, whose "Life of Alexander" is a late historical romance, not a history.</p>
      </q><q class="blockquote">
        <p>AMORION. The claim that Alexander founded Amorion is a modern one, based on the appearance of the name "Alexander" on coins of the city. The argument for the Macedonian king as the person mentioned on the coinage is unconvincing. More probably it is the name of a city magistrate.</p>
      </q><q class="blockquote">
        <p>APOLLONIA in Phrygia. In the nineteenth century J. G. Droysen suggested that the Macedonian king had founded Apollonia. He based this suggestion on Apollonian coinage of Imperial date with the name and the portrait of Alexander the Great. In fact the coins are to be connected with the Severan emperors of the early third century <span class="smallcaps"> A.D</span> ). There is the—remote— possibility of a connection between the Thracians in Apollonia mentioned on Apollonian coins and in inscriptions and some Thracians who served as guides for the Macedonian king when he was in the area. But this hardly proves he founded Apollonia.</p>
      </q><q class="blockquote">
        <p>CHRYSOPOLIS. Malalas, writing in the sixth century <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> , claimed that Alexander named this city. This is impossible. The only Chrysopolis in Bithynia was north of Kalchedon in an area never visited by Alexander. Furthermore, Xenophon, writing in the first half of the fourth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> , already knew of the town's existence (<i class="italic">Ahab</i> . 6.6.38).</p>
      </q><q class="blockquote">
        <p>EUKARPEIA. There is no ancient evidence that indicates unequivocally that the Macedonian king founded Eukarpeia. The possibility that he did found Eukarpeia is based on a suggestion of Thomas Drew-Bear. lie has called attention to an inscription found at Çorhisar in the Sandikli plain and dated palaeographically to the Imperial period that reads: "Alexander the Macedonian founder of the city" (<i class="italic">IGR</i> IV.692). He postulated that it was brought there from the site of Eukarpeia and, hence, that Alexander the Great was considered to be the founder of Eukarpeia. Based on the present state of the evidence this remains a speculative reconstruction.</p>
      </q><q class="blockquote">
        <p>ILION. Strabo (13.1.26) devotes a good deal of attention to Alexander's plans for Ilion. He says that Alexander adorned the temple of Athena with votive offerings, called the village of Ilion a "city," gave orders to improve it with buildings, and judged it free and exempt from tribute. Obviously a man with good intentions! The question is, what, substantively, did he do for Ilion? Very little, I suspect. Later he sent a letter to Ilion promising to make it a great city, to build a magnificent temple, and to announce</p>

        <p>sacred games. Again, the intentions are most commendable; the substance, however, probably never materialized. Finally, there was a tribe named Alexandris. The difficulty is that we do not know whether the tribe name referred to the Macedonian king or to Paris.</p>
      </q><q class="blockquote">
        <p>KRETOPOLIS. In recounting the events of 319 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> Diodorus mentions a Pisidian city, Kretopolis, that Antigonos Monophthalmos reached in the course of his struggle with Alketas (18.44.2; 47.4). There is no explicit ancient evidence indicating this was a Hellenistic colony. However, the toponym has led some modern scholars to suggest this was a Hellenistic colony, possibly founded by Alexander.</p>
      </q><q class="blockquote">
        <p>NIKAIA. Memnon of Herakleia (<i class="italic">FGrH</i> 434 F28) says that soldiers from Nikaia in Phokis who were fighting with Alexander founded Nikaia in Bithynia. There are coins of Imperial date from Nikaia that display a portrait of Alexander (e.g., Imhoof-Blumer, <i class="italic">Kl.M</i> ., 9, no. 3). However, the Macedonian king was never in this region, and hence it is unlikely that his veterans would have founded a colony here. On the other hand, Stephanos (s.v. "Nikaia") writes that Nikaia was a colony of Bottiaia in Macedonia. It may be, as Tscherikower suggests (47), that the Bottiaians were veterans of the army of Antigonos Monophthalmos.</p>

        <p>OTROUS. The connection between Otrous and Alexander the Great is extremely tenuous. The inscription found at Çorhisar (<i class="italic">IGR</i> IV.692) claims Alexander the Macedonian as the "founder of the city." The question is, which city? W. M. Ramsay has suggested that Çorhisar was the site of ancient Otrous. This is, however, only speculation. In fact the site of Otrous is not definitely known. Hence we cannot, based on the available evidence, claim Alexander as the founder of Otrous.</p>

        <p>PRIENE. The notion that Alexander refounded Priene is a modern one.

Schrader, believed that nothing at the site of the refounded city could be dated to before the Hellenistic period. Clearly Alexander was very interested in Priene: witness his dedication of the Athena Polias temple. However, one still awaits <i class="italic">firm and positive</i> evidence before ascribing the refoundation to him.</p>

      <p>It will immediately be dear that no settlement in Asia Minor can be unequivocally attributed to Alexander. In some cases the attributions are modern. In other cases the evidence for them is late, dating from the Roman period or even later. Of the thirteen cities, seven—Priene, Alexandreia by Latmos, Amorion, Apollonia in Phrygia, Eukarpeia, Otrous, and Kretopolis—have been championed by modern historians. Three—Chrysopolis, Alexandreia Troas, and Aigeai—are mentioned by late antique or Byzantine writers. Only three—Ilion, Smyrna, and Nikaia—preserve a tradition going back to antiquity, and even in these instances the tradition is hardly secure. Excavation at a number of sites—at Smyrna and Priene, for example—has yielded information for a <i class="italic">possible</i> attribution. In no case, however, is the extant evidence sufficient for firmly assigning any foundation in Asia Minor to Alexander.</p>

           Towns in Saia Minor With Evidence for Macedonians or macedonian connections</a></h2>
      <p>The towns in Asia Minor listed below provide evidence for the presence of Macedonians. The evidence comes in various forms: attestations in the literary sources, Macedonian personal and month names, the Macedonian shield on coins, the ethnic "Macedonian" in an inscription or on a coin. Since it was Macedonians under Alexander and his successors who conquered and colonized the Hellenistic world, evidence for their presence at a particular site is always welcome and potentially useful. Nevertheless one must exercise caution in utilizing this information. The appearance of a single Macedonian name at a site—in the absence of other data—is insufficient to prove the existence of a Macedonian colony. The ethnic "Macedonian" is found on the coins and inscriptions of a number of towns primarily in Lydia and Phrygia. However, one should note that the chronological framework for this evidence is different for each of the two regions. The Lydian evidence dates primarily from the second century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> The evidence from Phrygia and neighboring regions, on the other hand, first appears in the second and third centuries <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> —long after the period of Hellenistic colonization (see G. M. Cohen, <i class="italic"> Anc. Soc</i> . 22 [1991]41-50).</p>
      <p>(?) = The evidence for a Macedonian presence in the town is particularly weak.</p>

           Refoundations and New foundations</a></h2>
      <p>The evidence for settlements that were refoundings or renamings of older urban centers is quite extensive. It is clear that the Hellenistic monarchs focused much of their energy on urbanization: on the older cities in Greece, the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and native towns in other parts of Asia Minor. Frequently ancient authors will indicate what the name of the town had been before it was refounded or renamed, or will specify that a particular place had resulted from a synoecism. Similarly inscriptions will occasionally make reference to a <i class="italic">synoikismos</i> . I have noted elsewhere that the term could be used to describe a number of different processes. It could, for example, refer to the political unification of various towns with or without the inhabitants actually moving or the repopulation of a city with former inhabitants who had fled.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the evidence for new settlements is meager. By "new" I mean a foundation built at a previously uninhabited site. And even in these cases the site was often near or adjacent to an older town. The relatively few firm attestations for new foundations undoubtedly reflect the fact that most of the Hellenistic colonies resulted from the refounding or renaming of older settlements. It was obviously less expensive and less burdensome to refound an existing town than to establish a new settlement at a previously uninhabited site. Furthermore one should always bear in mind that the fragmentary nature of the evidence severely restricts our knowledge about the history of many of the colonies.</p>

           Population Transfer</a></h2>
      <p>Many of the Hellenistic foundations were established as a result of population transfer: the Greek and Macedonian settlers were immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. This fact found later expression in the many colonies that claimed descent from Macedonians, Achaeans, Ionians, Dorians, etc. In addition, for some foundations there are statements or indications that a transfer of population was involved in establishing the new colony. Among these were the following:</p>
      <p>Katoikia of the Aigosages</p>
      <p>Antigoneia Mantineia</p>
      <p>Antioch near Pisidia</p>
      <p>Antioch on the Maeander (?)</p>
      <p>Attaleia in Pamphylia (?)</p>
      <p>Berenike on Chios</p>

      <p>Kardakon Kome (?)</p>
      <p>Petsels (?)</p>
      <p>Philippopolis Phthiofic Thebes</p>
      <p>Other colonies included people who were moved from a town(s) or village(s) in the vicinity of the new foundation. The following were among such colonies:</p>

      <p>Reaching out into the Hellenistic world, SELEUKEIA Tralleis exchanged <i class="italic">isopoliteia</i> with Miletos, ARSINOE in Cilicia did likewise with Nagidos, while the citizens of ANTIOCH Alabanda were given Athenian citizenship (see further, Gawantka, <i class="italic"> Isopolitie</i> ). Both LAODIKEIA on the Lykos and ANTIOCH near Pisidia accepted the invitation of Magnesia on the Maeander to join in celebration of the festival of Artemis Leukophryene.</p>
      <p>Assertions of <i class="italic">syngeneia</i> were not uncommon. ANTIOCH near Pisidia claimed it with Magnesia on the Maeander, and ANTIOCH on the Maeander had a similar relationship with Samos. In the Imperial period Eumeneia in Phrygia minted coins with the legend </p>

      <p>Some colonies were organized along military lines. The Seleucid colony at THYATEIRA certainly had a military organization in its early history as did the colonies at MAGNESIA and PALAIMAGNESIA. STRATONIKEIA in Caria had a military organization alongside its civic structure. The nameless Attalid colony of <i class="italic">RG</i> 51 (see PERGAMON) had a military organization, as did the various foundations concentrated in Lydia from which there arc dedicatory or honorific inscriptions made by </p>

      : AGATHEIRA, DOIDYE, -ESPOURA, KOBEDYLE, -ALEIA, LASNEDDA. It is possible that some of the other towns in Phrygia and neighboring regions that provide evidence for Macedonians in the Roman period may have originated as military colonies. In addition there were other foundations whose population included soldiers or ex-soldiers. These included the following:

      <p>There are also a number of localities, primarily in Caria, that had soldiers living in or around a city. These soldiers may have been or may have become military colonists. Cities and towns in this category include IASOS, MYLASA, and PENTACHORA. There are other indications that individual soldiers and settlers could receive allotments of land. According to Diodorus (19.25.2) Antigonos Monophthalmos promised to give large allotments to deserters from Eumenes' army. As R. A. Billows suggests, what he promised deserters from Eumenes' army he surely must have given his own officers and men (<i class="italic">Antigonos</i> , 300).</p>

           Ethnics and Toponyms</a></h2>
      <p>Ethnics of cities are to be found on coins, in inscriptions, and in the literary evidence. The ethnic for any particular city will rarely be uniform. Minor variations in spelling were quite common. Similarly, abbreviations on coins take many forms. The appended list is not exhaustive. It gives the main ethnics attested for the cities listed in this book.</p>
      <p>A note about Stephanos of Byzantion: in his appropriately named <i class="italic">Ethnika</i> Stephanos gives the ethnics of cities. Unfortunately his information is not always correct. For example, under "Attaleia" he lists two cities, one in Lydia and one in Cilicia. He then gives the ethnic for both as </p>
      <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00765.gif"></figure>
      . There are two problems: the Attaleia Stephanos lists in Cilicia was actually in Pamphylia (see my discussion, s.v. ATTALEIA in Pamphylia). According to the epigraphic and numismatic evidence the ethnic for the Lydian city was ATTA<span class="Symbol">L</span> EATH<span class="Symbol">S</span> and for the Pamphylian city, 
      <figure class="inline"><img src="https://ucpec.s3.amazonaws.com/ft9w1009ss_00766.gif"></figure>
      . As a result, where I have made use of Stephanos' information, I have placed an asterisk next to those ethnics for which he is our sole source of information.

          <p> The circumstances of the rebuilding of Stageira are variously reported in the sources. According to Plutarch (<i class="italic">Alex</i> . 7.2) Philip himself restored the city. Elsewhere, however, Plutarch says Aristotle refounded the city (<i class="italic">Mor</i> . 1097B and 1126F). In fact Aristotle's name is frequently found in connection with the rebuilding of Stageira. Other sources, for example, mention Aristotle's role in interceding with Philip or asking Alexander to do this (D.L. 5.4). Dio Chrysostom remarks (47.9) that it was said of Aristotle that he alone had the good fortune to be the founder of his own fatherland. The <i class="italic">Vita Aristotelis Marciana</i> (83-87, ed. O. Gigon) adds that in gratitude the Stageirites established a festival, the Aristoteleia, and named one of their months after the philosopher.

          <p> There were Seleucid mints, for example, at LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, ILION, ALEXANDREIA Troas, PERGAMON, Ephesos (ARSINOE), Smyrna (EURYDIKEIA), SARDIS, Tarsos (ANTIOCH on the Kydnos), and SELEUKEIA on the Kalykadnos; see Newell, <i class="italic">WSM</i> , 214-358; Houghton, <i class="italic"> CSE</i> , 51-61.</p>
          <p>Lysimachos' mints are attested at, among other places, LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, ALEXANDREIA Troas, PERGAMON, EURYDIKEIA Smyrna, ARSINOE Ephesos, KOLOPHON, SARDIS, Kios (PROUSIAS by the Sea); see M. Thompson, in <i class="italic">Essays S. Robinson</i> , 163-82.</p>
          <p>Demetrios Poliorketes had mints at DEMETRIAS Sikyon (?), DEMETRIAS in Thessaly, Ephesos (ARSINOE), and Tarsos; see further, E. T. Newell, <i class="italic">The Coinages of Demetrius Poliorceles</i> (London, 1927).</p>
          <p>There are no royal mints firmly attested at any of the Ptolemaic foundations in Greece, the Aegean (including Crete), Cyprus, or Asia Minor. In fact the evidence for Ptolemaic mints in this region is pretty much confined to Kition, Salamis, Paphos, and, possibly, Amathous in Cyprus and, briefly, Korinth (around 308 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ) as well Ephesos (around 240 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> ).
