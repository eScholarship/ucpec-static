            <head rend="Heading-Heading2B">Preface</head>
            <p>The object of the present work is to identify the Hellenistic settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor and to gather information about their early history. A second volume will deal with Asia and North Africa. The basic organization of the book is by geographic areas—Thrace, the Islands, Mysia, etc. Within each area the colonies are ordered alphabetically. The entry for each foundation has two basic sections: narrative and annotation. In the narrative I attempt to identify the settlements, their founders, and location. I also try to present information about each settlement's early history and organization. The extended annotation is keyed to the narrative and provides detailed references, citations, and discussions for the material covered there. At the end of the work I have included a series of appendices that attempt to distill some of the information in the collected entries.</p>
            <p>When Victor Tscherikower wrote <hi rend="italic">Die hellenistischen Städtegründungen</hi> he limited his study, as its title indicates, to city foundations. In my own enumeration I have tried to account for both the city foundations and the smaller, rural settlements. The evidence for the latter is limited primarily to western Asia Minor: settlements of the Macedonians, Jews, and Kardakians, among others, at various sites.</p>
            <p>I faced a problem when dealing with the numerous epigraphic references to <hi rend="italic">katoikiai, katoikoi</hi> , etc. These inscriptions are all found in western Asia Minor. And practically all of them date from the Imperial period. Did these <hi rend="italic">katoikiai</hi> originate as Hellenistic military colonies? B. Bar-Kochva, in his book <hi rend="italic">The Seleucid Army</hi> (24ff.), claimed that the fact that the <hi rend="italic"> katoikiai</hi> are confined to western Asia Minor shows they did begin as Hellenistic military colonies. I do not think this is correct. Certainly we would like to know why—if these <hi rend="italic"> katoikiai</hi> began as Hellenistic colonies—it took over three hundred years before</p>
            <pb id="JD_Page_xii" n="xii"/>
            <p>inscriptional evidence for over fifty of them suddenly began appearing in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> and later. On this problem, I believe Louis Robert (<hi rend="italic">Études anatoliennes</hi> , 191-94) has correctly defined the situation. The term <hi rend="italic">katoikos</hi> does designate a military colonist of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> in Ptolemaic Egypt. In western Asia Minor, however, the <hi rend="italic"> katoikiai</hi> show no evidence of either a military organization or a Hellenistic origin. Inscriptions from the Hellenistic period that do record the existence of military colonies—that is, inscriptions mentioning Macedonians or <hi rend="italic">stratiotai</hi> —do not normally use the term <hi rend="italic">katoikia</hi> . In the Roman period the term is employed so loosely and vaguely, most often as the equivalent of <hi rend="italic">kome</hi> , that one can conclude very little from the use of the term by itself. For this reason I usually do not include villages whose existence as <hi rend="italic">katoikiai</hi> is attested solely by late inscriptional evidence.</p>
            <p>A comment about my treatment of some of the older, Greek cities that were simply renamed, often for a very short time. Since these cities were established and often were flourishing centers long before the advent of Alexander, I do not devote extensive attention to their organization and history in the Hellenistic period other than as regards changes or innovations related to the refounding.</p>
            <p>In its early stages I was privileged to discuss this work with my late advisor and friend, John V. A. Fine.</p>
            <p>While writing this book I have benefited from the advice and criticism of many friends. I am particularly grateful to Christian Habicht, Erich Gruen, Roger Bagnall, and Stanley Burstein, for their careful and judicious reading of my manuscript. In addition, Richard Billows, Eugene Borza, Thomas Drew-Bear, Clive Foss, Peter Herrmann, Arthur Houghton, Christopher Jones, Fred Kleiner, Stephen Mitchell, and the anonymous reader at the University of California Press made many helpful comments and criticisms. Of course I alone am responsible for any errors.</p>
            <p>I am grateful to Bill Nelson for his preparation of the maps. Mary Lamprech and Marian Rodgers have been a great help to me in converting manuscript to finished product.</p>
            <p>Randall Saunders helped with the preparation of the bibliography, Mischa Hooker and Philip Kennedy with the checking of footnotes and references. I am grateful to them, as I am to Jennifer Kingma for typing an early draft of this work.</p>
            <p>The transliteration of Greek personal and place-names is a perennial problem. Generally I have used the Greek spelling for the personal names of historical personages and town names but have relied on Latin usage for regional names and ancient authors. Depending upon the language in which he wrote, Elias Bickerman also spelled his surname Bickermann or Bikerman. In this volume I use the spelling Bickerman throughout.</p>

            <p>It is a particular pleasure to acknowledge the support provided by the Classics Fund of the University of Cincinnati that Louise Taft Semple established in memory of her father, Charles Phelps Taft. The Fund and its trustees help immeasurably "to make vital and constructive in the civilization of our country the spiritual, intellectual and esthetic inheritance we have received from the Greek and Roman civilizations."</p>
            <p>Much of this book was written in the Classics Library of the University of Cincinnati, at the library of the Institute for Classical Studies in London, and at the library of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. I am very grateful to the staff of each of the libraries for their continuing and gracious assistance.</p>
            <p>My greatest debt, however, is to Sheila.</p>

               <p>In 1927 Victor Tscherikower published <hi rend="italic">Die hellenistischen Städtegründungen</hi> . Drawing on earlier investigations of J. G. Droysen (<hi rend="italic">Histoire de l'hellénisme</hi> ), G. Radet (<hi rend="italic">De Coloniis a Macedonibus in Asiam Cis Taurum Deductis</hi> ), and K. F. Hermann and H. Swoboda (<hi rend="italic">Griechische Staatsaltertümer</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">6</hi> ), Tscherikower compiled a definitive list of the colonies of the Hellenistic world. This became and has remained the standard work for anyone interested in Hellenistic colonies. It is now over sixty years since the publication of Tscherikower's work. Much new information has come to light that renders Tscherikower's enumeration badly in need of revision. When he wrote his work in 1926, Tscherikower had 97 entries for Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor. The present study has over 180. The expansion of our knowledge of colonization can be seen both in the greater number of settlements and in the additional information that has surfaced for already attested foundations. For practically every entry in the present work some new piece of evidence has been discovered or some new interpretation has been suggested.</p>
               <p>For example, in 1968 Georges Le Rider demonstrated by a comparison of coin types that Rhithymna on Crete had been renamed ARSINOE. The presence of a Ptolemaic colony named PHILOTERA in Lycia was first discovered in 1979 with the publication of a fragmentary inscription from Telmessos that recorded a town of this name. The existence of EUKARPEIA in Phrygia has long been known from Strabo (12.8.13). But it was only in 1956 that two inscriptions—both from the early third century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> —provided the first evidence that there probably had been a military colony at Eukarpeia. These inscriptions (<hi rend="italic">SEG</hi> XV.810, 812) mentioned offices and titles, including</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_2" n="2"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">klerouchos, stratiotes, bouleutes</hi> , and <hi rend="italic"> eirenarches</hi> . The first term, <hi rend="italic">klerouchos</hi> , undoubtedly originated in a Hellenistic military colony and may be taken, I believe, as evidence that there had been a Hellenistic foundation at Eukarpeia.</p>
               <p>In other cases new information has subsequently—and dramatically— increased our knowledge about a particular site. Two examples from recent archaeological excavations illustrate the point. In discussing King Lysimachos' refounding of Ephesos as an ARSINOE, Strabo comments that the inhabitants were reluctant to move from the old city to the new site, but does not indicate why (14.1.21). In 1978 archaeologists digging at Ephesos found the remains of archaic graves in the agora of the new Hellenistic city. Undoubtedly the presence of graves at the new site was the reason the Ephesians did not want to move. At HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia inscriptions were found on the edges of seats in the theater and published in 1974. The inscriptions were from the Imperial period and recorded the names of the following tribes: Seleukis, Antiochis, Laodikis, Eumenis, Attalis, Stratonikis, and the <hi rend="italic"> prote phyle</hi> of Apollonias. Prior to the discovery of these inscriptions there had been extensive discussion as to whether Hierapolis was a Seleucid or an Attalid foundation. The publication of these inscriptions firmly resolves the question in favor of the Seleucids.</p>
               <p>Newly discovered evidence can also allow us to remove a town from the ranks of Hellenistic settlements. This was the case for KADOI in Lydia. Prior to 1975 it had been claimed that Kadoi was a Macedonian colony. The evidence cited was Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.111: <hi rend="italic">Sardiana nunc appellatur ea iurisdictio, conveniuntque in eam extra praedictos Macedones Cadieni, Philadelphini etc</hi> . In 1975 Christian Habicht published a Flavian <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list from Ephesos that recorded a list of communities in the province of Asia. It mentioned the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00026.gif"/> (I.1) and the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00027.gif"/> (I.6) as separate entities. Hence, Habicht correctly suggested that in Pliny's list there has to be a comma after <hi rend="italic"> Macedones</hi> in order to mark the separation from the following <hi rend="italic">Cadieni</hi> and thus that Kadoi was not a Macedonian colony. Similarly, EUMENEIA in Caria was cited by Tscherikower as being among the Hellenistic foundations of that region. In 1935, however, Louis Robert demonstrated that a passage in Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.108) that served as one of the main buttresses for claiming Eumeneia as a Hellenistic colony was problematic, because at this point in his text Pliny had mistakenly inserted a group of Phrygian toponyms in his list of Carian cities. Hence we should remove Eumeneia from the Hellenistic foundations of Caria.</p>
               <p>ARSINOE in Cilicia had long been known from Strabo (14.5.3) and other later sources. But, other than its approximate location and the fact that Strabo says it had a landing place, not much was known about it. Then in 1989 E. Kirsten and I. Opelt published an inscription recording a letter from the <hi rend="italic">strategos</hi> of Cilicia, Thraseas, to Arsinoe and a decree of Nagidos regarding</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_3" n="3"/>
               <p>its relations with Arsinoe. The inscription provides detailed information about the founding and later embellishment of Arsinoe. This inscription is very important, both for the light it sheds on the political history of the Ptolemies overseas and for the information it provides about Ptolemaic colonization. It is in fact the first document to provide something more than a fragmentary picture of the organization of a Ptolemaic overseas settlement.</p>
               <p>These and other new discoveries and interpretations will be found in the scholarship on Hellenistic colonies of the last sixty years. In the present work I have taken account of these developments so as to identify those cities and towns that were Hellenistic foundations and refoundations and to gather information about their early history and organization.</p>
               <p>In the years since Tscherikower published his work, the study of the settlements has usually been undertaken as part of a larger investigation, either of a particular king or dynasty, region or topic. The Seleucid colonization program, not surprisingly, has received the most attention from scholars. E. Bickerman (<hi rend="italic">Institutions des Séleucides</hi> , 1938), M. I. Rostovtzeff (<hi rend="italic">The Social and Economic History of the Hellenistic World</hi> , 1941), W. W. Tarn (<hi rend="italic">The Greeks in Bactria and India</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 1951), D. Musti ("Lo stato dei Seleucidi," <hi rend="italic">SCO</hi> 15 [1966] 61ff.), B. Bar-Kochva (<hi rend="italic">The Seleucid Army</hi> , 1976), and G. M. Cohen (<hi rend="italic">The Seleucid Colonies</hi> , 1978) all have devoted considerable attention to the Seleucid settlements. P. Briant ("Colonisation hellénistique et populations indigènes," <hi rend="italic">Klio</hi> 60 [1978] 57ff.) and A. H. M. Jones (<hi rend="italic">The Greek City from Alexander to Justinian</hi> , 1940) have had much to say about both the Seleucid and the other Hellenistic foundations.</p>
               <p>The colonizing activity of the various kings has been discussed by J. D. Grainger (<hi rend="italic">Seleukos Nikator</hi> , 1990; <hi rend="italic">The Cities of Seleukid Syria</hi> , 1990), W. Orth (<hi rend="italic">Königlicher Machtanspruch und städtische Freiheit</hi> , 1977), H. H. Schmitt (<hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen zur Geschichte Antiochos' des Grossen und seiner Zeit</hi> , 1964), and O. Mørkholm (<hi rend="italic">Antiochus IV of Syria</hi> , 1966). R. A. Billows (<hi rend="italic">Antigonos the One-Eyed and the Creation of the Hellenistic State</hi> , 1990), C. Wehrli (<hi rend="italic">Antigone et Démétrios</hi> , 1968), and W. W. Tarn (<hi rend="italic">Antigonos Gonatas</hi> , 1913) investigated the Antigonid settlements. The Attalid colonies have been studied by E. V. Hansen (<hi rend="italic">The Attalids of Pergamon</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 1971), R. E. Allen (<hi rend="italic">The Attalid Kingdom</hi> , 1983), and J. Hopp (<hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der letzten Attaliden</hi> , 1977). R. S. Bagnall (<hi rend="italic">The Administration of the Ptolemaic Possessions outside Egypt</hi> , 1976), G. Longega (<hi rend="italic">Arsinoe II</hi> , 1968), and W. Huss (<hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen zur Aussenpolitik Ptolemaios IV</hi> , 1976) have investigated the Ptolemaic settlements.</p>
               <p>Regional studies often involve discussions of colonies. For example, N. G. L. Hammond, G. T. Griffith, and F. W. Walbank (<hi rend="italic">A History of Macedonia</hi> , vols. 1-3, 1972-88), as well as F. Papazoglou (<hi rend="italic">Les villes de Macédoine à l'époque romaine</hi> , 1988), should be consulted for settlements in Macedonia. M. Zahrnt (<hi rend="italic">Olynth und die Chalkidier</hi> , 1971) is especially useful for Hellenistic settlements on the Chalcidic peninsula. For Asia Minor, D. Magie's <hi rend="italic">Roman Rule in Asia Minor</hi>
               </p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_4" n="4"/>
               <p>(1950) is particularly important. The discussions in volume I and the extended footnotes in volume 2 provide an excellent introduction to Hellenistic studies in that area. Louis Robert has written extensively and with great acumen on Asia Minor. His monographs and studies are resources of the utmost importance. For the Troad, for example, Robert's <hi rend="italic">Monnaies antiques en Troade</hi> (1966) is especially useful, as is the survey of J. M. Cook (<hi rend="italic">The Troad</hi> , 1973). For Caria, Louis and Jeanne Robert (<hi rend="italic">La Carie</hi> , vol. 2, 1954; <hi rend="italic">nota bene</hi> : vol. 1 was never published), A. Mastrocinque (<hi rend="italic">La Caria e la Ionia meridionale in epoca ellenistica</hi> , 1979), and A. Laumonier (<hi rend="italic">Cultes indigènes en Carie</hi> , 1958) provide an excellent introduction to the region and the settlements in it. D. R. Wilson (<hi rend="italic">The Historical Geography of Bithynia, Paphlagonia and Pontus in the Greek and Roman Periods</hi> , 1960) and E. Olshausen and J. Biller (<hi rend="italic">Historisch-geographische Aspekte der Geschichte des pontischen und armenischen Reiches</hi> , vol. 1, 1984) are important resources for northern Asia Minor, as are Robert (<hi rend="italic">À travers l'Asie Mineure</hi> , 1980) and G. Vitucci (<hi rend="italic">Il regno di Bitinia</hi> , 1953).</p>
               <p>In addition to regional studies, topical studies have also discussed settlements. Habicht, in his important <hi rend="italic">Gottmenschentum und griechische Städte</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (1970), investigated civic cults in the early Hellenistic period and called attention to their appearance in Hellenistic colonies. W. Leschhorn (<hi rend="italic">Gründer der Stadt</hi> , 1984) dealt with Hellenistic founders and the honors they received, while L. Boffo (<hi rend="italic">I re ellenistici e i centri religiosi dell' Asia Minore</hi> , 1985) considered, among other things, the many sanctuaries in and near the Hellenistic settlements. Finally, a partial list of settlements can be found in many of the books I have already mentioned and in Jones's <hi rend="italic">Cities of the Eastern Roman Provinces</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (1971).</p>

                  <p>relied heavily on Polybius for the parts of his history that deal with affairs in Greece. In short, for the eastern Mediterranean in the third and second centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> there is no extant continuous history. To compensate for this lacuna we must turn to other ancient authors and other sources of information. I have noted examples of archaeology adding to our knowledge of colonization; the epigraphic and numismatic sources also supply vital information. Before turning to these sources, however, I will discuss the literary evidence.</p>
                  <p>Literary evidence for the Hellenistic settlements comes from both Greek and Roman as well as Byzantine sources. The geographic surveys of Strabo and Pliny and the <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> of Ptolemy are primary resources.</p>
                  <p>Strabo (64/3 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> -21 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ), who was from Amaseia in Pontus, wrote a <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> in seventeen books. Books 8-10 deal with Greece (largely antiquarian), 11 with the Euxine-Caspian region, and 12-14 with Asia Minor. Although he did travel (2.5.11), Strabo relied on the works of others for much of his information. Among these were Artemidorus of Ephesos (fl. 104 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ) and, for the Troad, Demetrius of Skepsis (early second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ). The latter wrote a learned geographical description of the Troad (in thirty books!) as a commentary on the Catalogue of Ships in the <hi rend="italic"> Iliad</hi> . Strabo's primary strength and significance is as a historical rather than a physical geographer. His work is essentially an encyclopedia of historical geography. His account of a particular city will often give information about its location and the topography of the surrounding region, a brief historical outline, and descriptions of major monuments and religious sanctuaries as well as famous natives. In short, for an account of cities and towns, particularly in Asia Minor, Strabo is an important and authoritative source.</p>
                  <p>Pliny the Elder (23/4-79 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ) wrote a number of works of which only the <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> survives. In thirty-seven books, it is an encyclopedia of scientific fields as diverse as botany and zoology, minerals and their use in medicine, art and architecture. Geography and ethnography are treated in books 3-6. If Strabo's <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> can be described as a historical geography, then these books of Pliny's <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> can be described as an annotated list of cities and regions. Pliny normally follows a geographic order in enumerating cities and localities, often appending brief comments regarding their physical features. Although generally reliable, he occasionally gives erroneous information. I have already pointed out, for example, that at <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.108 he mistakenly inserted a group of Phrygian place-names in a list of Carian cities.</p>
                  <p>Ptolemy's <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> is a bare list of places. Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus, fl. c. 140 <hi rend="smallcaps"> A.D.</hi> ) was a geographer, mathematician, and astronomer. His <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> is a treatise in eight books whose purpose is to locate places by latitude and longitude on a map. Very rarely did Ptolemy add a historical or ethnographic note. Despite its great authority in antiquity and the Middle Ages, the <hi rend="italic"> Geography</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb id="JD_Page_6" n="6"/>
                  <p>has serious faults. For example, Ptolemy preferred Posidonius' estimate of 180,000 stades for the earth's circumference instead of the more nearly correct 250,000 stades posited by Eratosthenes. This, of course, skewed the distance between any two points of longitude. In a few cases he plotted the same town in two different places: thus he apparently gives Olba twice, in Cilicia and Cappadocia. Nevertheless, Ptolemy's <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> was and is an important geographical reference work and can be used for the relative location of sites in antiquity.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the three geographers, a number of ancient historians and Plutarch appear with less frequency as sources of information. Polybius, Livy, Diodorus, and Pausanias all provide important details about colonization in Europe as well as Asia Minor. Both Appian (in his <hi rend="italic">Mithridatika</hi> ) and Memnon provide evidence for Mithridates Eupator's activities. And last, Plutarch's fives of Alexander, Demetrios, Pyrrhos, and Lucullus contain important evidence.</p>
                  <p>Because classical toponyms frequently appear in Byzantine literature, it is useful to consult the later geographers and the various episcopal city lists. As these authors and sources are possibly less well known than the classical authors, I provide brief notes about the more frequently cited sources.</p>
                  <p>The best-known Byzantine antiquarian is, of course, Stephanos of Byzantion (fl. c. 528-535 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ). His <hi rend="italic">Ethnika</hi> , which survives in abridged form, is a fist of geographic names to which are appended items of historical or mythological interest. Stephanos' sources included Strabo and Pausanias. Despite the relative wealth of information he preserved, Stephanos must be consulted with caution: he frequently is confused or mistaken (see, for example, ANTIOCH on the Maeander and STRATONIKEIA in Lydia). Nevertheless, he often preserves information not found elsewhere and for this reason is an important, if erratic, source.</p>
                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tabula Peutingeriana</hi> is a twelfth- or early-thirteenth-century map based on a fifth-century copy that may ultimately have been derived from a map prepared by Marcus Agrippa. It is twenty-one feet long and one foot wide, depicting the known world from the tip of England to India and Ceylon. The segment comprising the British Isles and the Iberian peninsula is lost. The map is well illustrated with pictures of cities, baths, temples, and harbors, among other things. It also indicates the roads and stations that were used by the Roman postal service.<ref target="fnd0e2447" type="fnoteref">2</ref> Distances between stations are given, but these are</p>

Finally, I would mention the <hi rend="italic"> Tabula Imperii Byzantini</hi> , a particularly thorough modern compendium of information on Byzantine geography.</p>
                  <p>As useful as the literary sources are, they do have certain limitations. For locating cities the various Byzantine lists are helpful only to the degree that they follow a geographic rather than a hierarchic or random order. The ancient historians generally give information about colonies only in passing. They are usually interested in other events and mention a particular city or town only because something happened there. Occasionally, however, they do give substantive information. Thus Plutarch in his life of Demetrios provides important information about the refounding and enhancement of Sikyon as a Demetrias. Appian and Livy both supply useful information about Antiochos III's refounding of Lysimacheia in Thrace. And Appian in his <hi rend="italic">Syriaka</hi> (57) gives a biographical sketch of Seleukos I in the course of which he lists the king's settlements. But these are exceptions. If the historians were, understandably, not primarily interested in cities and settlements, Strabo—a geographer—was. I have already discussed briefly Strabo's importance for the information about settlements that he does give us. But it is also necessary to bear in mind what he and the other geographers and historians do <hi rend="italic"> not</hi> give us: information about the political, constitutional, and certain of the religious institutions of the various cities. Either because he was not interested or, more probably, because he assumed his readers either knew or were themselves not interested, Strabo says little about these matters. For information on these institutions we must turn to the inscriptions.</p>

                  <p>Inscriptions have the great advantage of usually being contemporary with the event they commemorate and of being official records. Of course as official documents they may also be propaganda vehicles. Furthermore inscriptions are often incomplete and fragmentary, are frequently difficult to date precisely,</p>

                  <p>and may not have been found <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> . In addition we may often owe to chance the survival and discovery of an inscription. Nevertheless inscriptions are sources of evidence of the highest importance and, in the case of the Hellenistic settlements, provide us with vital information not available elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Inscriptions, for example, often record decrees of cities, and these decrees frequently supply important information about the constitutional apparatus: the magistracies, the council and assembly, the dating formula, tribal and month names, institutions such as the gymnasium and the <hi rend="italic">ephebeia</hi> and the various officials connected with each. Inscriptions provide evidence for citizens of a particular city being invited to settle lawsuits in other cities and acting as judges in international disputes as well as being appointed <hi rend="italic">proxenoi</hi> and winning races in international competitions. Inscriptions also record treaties and communications between cities, such as exchanges of <hi rend="italic"> isopoliteia</hi> (grants of potential citizenship to citizens of another city) and recognition of <hi rend="italic">asylia</hi> (freedom from reprisal and the right of receiving suppliants), as well as royal letters to cities.</p>
                  <p>Epigraphic evidence is our primary source of information for both honorific decrees and civic and dynastic cults. In addition, decrees and other inscribed materials with toponyms or ethnics can, if found <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> , help fix the location of cities. Thus the location of ANTIGONEIA in Epirus, long a matter of dispute, was settled with the recent discovery at a place overlooking the Drin River of bronze discs with the inscription ANTI<hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> ONE<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N.</p>
                  <p>The epigraphic evidence is obviously very valuable. Where it can be firmly dated and ascribed to a particular city it can provide us with contemporary and official documentation on the activities, the organization, and the administration of that city. All our literary sources with the exception of Polybius lived long after the Hellenistic period and were generally not interested in the organization and administration of cities and settlements. Even Strabo, who focuses on regions and cities, is not primarily interested in constitutional questions. In short, if it were not for the inscriptional evidence, we would have very little information regarding the way the settlements governed and managed themselves and the way they related to other cities and to the kings. APOLLONIA Salbake may serve as a good example of how informative the epigraphic evidence can be. The existence of Apollonia was always known from Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.109) and citations in Ptolemy and Hierokles. This was, however, essentially all that was known about Apollonia until the appearance of various inscriptions, all published within the last sixty years. A fragmentary inscription dated to the nineteenth year of the Seleucid era in the month of Panemos (June 243 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ) mentions "King Seleukos" and records the opening of a decree of the assembly. Another inscription, probably from the time of Antiochos III, mentions a council and assembly that granted, among other</p>
                  <pb id="JD_Page_10" n="10"/>
                  <p>things, citizenship rights, <hi rend="italic">ateleia</hi> , and <hi rend="italic">proedria</hi> to the Seleucid hipparch stationed there. Obviously there was a Seleucid garrison at Apollonia at this time. The inhabitants also celebrated a gymnastic <hi rend="italic">agon</hi> in honor of "King Seleukos." This is probably Seleukos I, and we are undoubtedly dealing with a city-founder cult. We also learn that in the vicinity of Apollonia there were "sacred villages" and a population, the Saleioi of the mountain and of the plain, who belonged to the sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>Since 1927 the study of Hellenistic inscriptions has been greatly facilitated by the appearance of a number of publications and publication series. The continuing fascicles of the <hi rend="italic">Tituli Asiae Minoris</hi> as well as volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Monumenta Asiae Minoris Antiqua</hi> , the <hi rend="italic">Inschriften griechischer Städte aus Kleinasien</hi> , and G. Dagron and D. Feissel's <hi rend="italic">Inscriptions de Cilicie</hi> are all vital resources for Asia Minor, as are the results of the epigraphic journeys of, among others, P. Herrmann, G. E. Bean and T. B. Mitford, and T. Drew-Bear. For THESSALONIKE the <hi rend="italic">Inscriptiones Graecae</hi> , X.2, fasc. 1, <hi rend="italic">Inscriptiones Thessalonicae et Viciniae</hi> , is of great importance. The publication of many new inscriptions since the appearance of Welles's <hi rend="italic">Royal Correspondence in the Hellenistic Period</hi> renders it in need of revision. Nevertheless it remains an important and useful collection. Another important collection is H. H. Schmitt, <hi rend="italic">Die Staatsverträge des Altertums</hi> III. Both the <hi rend="italic">Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum</hi> and the "Bulletin épigraphique" published regularly in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des études grecques</hi> by Jeanne and Louis Robert for so many years, and now continued by a group of scholars, are essential tools for keeping abreast of progress in epigraphy. The latter frequently contains incisive comments on numismatics as well.</p>

               <div3 type="ss2" id="d0e695">
                  <head rend="Heading-Heading4">Coins</head>
                  <p>It is possible to distinguish at least five categories for coins of the Hellenistic period: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> royal coins issued by the kings at their own mints, <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> coins minted for the kings by cities under their control, <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> cistophoric coinage issued under royal Attalid supervision in the name of certain cities of western Asia Minor, <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> civic or autonomous coins issued by the cities for their own use, and <hi rend="italic">(e)</hi> hybrid coins found especially in the reign of Antiochos IV Epiphanes minted by cities with the name of the issuing city on the reverse and a portrait of the king on the obverse.</p>
                  <p>The civic coins were normally minted in bronze, though some silver issues were also produced, and were intended for local circulation. Thus when Antiochos VII gave Simon the high priest in Jerusalem the right to coin money he specified that it was to be used locally (1 Macc. 15.6). In a study of the Hellenistic foundations we are primarily concerned with the civic rather than the royal coins. And in dealing with these coins one should bear in mind their</p>
                  <pb id="JD_Page_11" n="11"/>
                  <p>limitations—and potential—as evidence for the various settlements. In the first place the dating of these coins is extremely difficult. With the exception of the occasional appearance of a magistrate's name, the civic coinage normally does not carry any explicit indication of date. Hence the dating often is based on factors such as hoard evidence, die linkage, or historical context. These factors, however useful, cannot be substituted for historical evidence unless they are, in turn, anchored in a firmly datable event or personage. It is important to emphasize this because numismatists and historians frequently tend to assume that numismatic "events"—for example, the appearance of a new weight system, new coin types, etc.—are tied to historical events. In many cases this may be true, but it is not a certainty; in short, it is an axiom, not a proven theorem.</p>
                  <p>In the second place the attribution of coins can change. A change in attribution can result from the study of such factors as monograms, coin types, or magistrates' names. Thus in 1979 Mørkholm suggested that cistophori with the monogram <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00028.gif"/> belonged not with APAMEIA Kelainai but with either Parion in the Hellespont or Apollonia on the Rhyndakos. More recently, however, R. Bauslaugh and Le Rider have argued convincingly that the original attribution to Apameia is to be preferred. And while coins of an Antioch with a Maeander River symbol can confidently be assigned to ANTIOCH on the Maeander, other Antioch coins have been attributed and reattributed to ANTIOCH Alabanda, Kebren, in Mysia, and near Pisidia. Furthermore coins of Arsinoe have been reassigned to and from ARSINOE Lyktou, Rhithymna, and Methana, while reattributions have occurred for the various APOLLONIAS (Salbake, on the Maeander, in Phrygia, and on the Rhyndakos) as well as for PTOLEMAIS Larisa, Lebedos, in Caria, and in Pamphylia.</p>
                  <p>If the attribution and reattribution of coins to cities is sometimes frustrating, at other times it has resulted in the identification and location of a number of Hellenistic settlements. I have already mentioned that the refounding of Rhithymna as an ARSINOE is known only from the numismatic evidence. The same is also true for, among other cities, EURYDIKEIA (Smyrna), ANTIOCH on the Saros (Adana), and SELEUKEIA on the Pyramos (Mopsuestia). In these cases the identification was initially made by comparing the coin types of issues bearing the name of the Hellenistic foundations with those of the native city. In other instances the combined evidence of epigraphic and numismatic sources has also yielded identifications. For example, we learn from inscriptions and coins that Lebedos was refounded as a PTOLEMAIS, that APOLLONIA was an earlier name of Tripolis in Lydia, and that PHILADELPHEIA in Lydia, itself a Hellenistic settlement, was later refounded as Neocaesarea.</p>
                  <pb id="JD_Page_12" n="12"/>
                  <p>As with epigraphy, the study of numismatics as it relates to the Hellenistic settlements has made great strides in the last sixty years. Of particular interest are two great collections of the <hi rend="italic"> Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum</hi> (<hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> )—that of the Danish National Museum, Copenhagen, and that of Hans von Aulock. In addition the collection in R. Ziegler's <hi rend="italic">Münzen Kilikiens aus kleineren deutschen Sammlungen</hi> (1988) and the Tübingen and Switzerland <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> volumes, to name just a few, are quite useful. E. T. Newell's <hi rend="italic">Western Seleucid Mints</hi> and A. Houghton's <hi rend="italic">Coins of the Seleucid Empire</hi> are concerned with the issues of royal mints. They and Le Rider, among others, have made major contributions to Hellenistic numismatics. In addition, von Aulock has concentrated on the cities of Phrygia, Lycaonia, and Pisidia in three volumes. Louis Robert has focused on numismatics in a number of studies, and Mørkholm, in numerous articles, longer investigations, and, most recently, in his posthumous <hi rend="italic"> Early Hellenistic Coinage</hi> , has made major contributions to Hellenistic numismatics. The regional reviews of numismatic literature begun in the <hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch für Numismatik und Geldgeschichte</hi> in 1955 and continued in <hi rend="italic">Chiron</hi> in 1972 are particularly helpful, as is <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Literature</hi> , which, since 1949, has provided a useful listing with brief summaries of published work.</p>

                  <head rend="Heading-Heading4">Archaeology</head>
                  <p>It hardly needs to be said that the study of Hellenistic foundations has been immeasurably helped by archaeology. Our knowledge of Hellenistic city planning, for example, has been expanded tremendously by the results of excavations. One thinks immediately of PRIENE; another particularly fruitful excavation has been that at DEMETRIAS in Thessaly.</p>
                  <p>Excavations have occasionally provided solutions to previously unanswerable historical questions. I have already mentioned the reluctance of the Ephesians to move to the new site of ARSINOE chosen by Lysimachos and the solution to this problem that was offered by archaeology. I would also recall that the question whether HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia was a Seleucid or an Attalid settlement was finally settled by the discovery of inscribed theater seats that first came to light in the course of excavation. The mention of the inscribed theater seats at Hierapolis brings us back to the epigraphic and numismatic evidence, for it is frequently archaeological excavations that have yielded the inscriptions and coins that play such an important role in allowing us to reconstruct the history of a particular town.</p>
                  <p>To keep abreast of progress in archaeology one may turn to a number of sources. The <hi rend="italic">Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites</hi> , published in 1976, is a useful compendium of information on the major towns and cities.

               <p>Alexander the Great changed the face of the Middle East. He came to the throne in 336 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , invaded the Persian Empire two years later, and by the time he died in 323 had completely overrun the kingdom of Darius III. In so doing he brought under his control most of the Middle East as well as parts of central Asia and northern India, thus opening up a new world to the Macedonians and Greeks. Clearly it was necessary to establish a presence as visible and strong as possible. One means of exerting control was to settle retired Macedonian and Greek soldiers at various strategic points. Practically all of Alexander's colonies were in the East, in areas beyond the purview of this volume. Nevertheless, because of Alexander's influence on the Hellenistic world in general and Hellenistic colonization in particular, it is useful to discuss briefly his role as a colonizer and the background to his colonizing activities.</p>
               <p>The antecedents to Alexander's settlement program are complex. They can be found in both Europe and the Middle East. In the <hi rend="italic"> Philip</hi> (120), written in 346 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> , Isocrates had addressed the problem of the unemployed in Greece and had suggested to Philip II that he conquer Asia Minor, found new cities along the border areas, and settle in them those unemployed at the time in Greece. They would serve, in Isocrates' words, as a "buffer" vis-à-vis the Persians. At the same time, Philip would solve a major social problem facing fourth-century Greece.<ref target="fnd0e2848" type="fnoteref">1</ref> As precedents for this great colonization scheme Isocrates</p>

The Eretrians and the Milesians, for example, were deported to Susiana and the Red Sea coast, respectively.<ref target="fnd0e2926" type="fnoteref">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Philip used population transfer and colonization as part of his program to pacify and control areas under his rule. Justin provides the clearest statement of this policy: "Returning to his kingdom, as shepherds move their flocks now to winter, now to summer pastures, so he [Philip] transported people and cities, according to his whim, as places appeared to him to need to be restored or abandoned.... Some people he installed on the frontiers against his enemies, others he placed in the most remote parts of his kingdom; some whom he had taken prisoner he distributed to supplement the populations of the cities. And thus from many tribes and nations he established one kingdom and people" (8.5.7-6.2).</p>
               <p>Beginning with the refounding of Krenides in Thrace as Philippoi in 356 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , Philip followed a policy of "founding strong cities at important places" in order to gain control of the Thracians (Diod. 16.71.1-2).<ref target="fnd0e2930" type="fnoteref">4</ref> Some</p>

               <p>of Philip's colonies involved the movement of (unwilling) Macedonians to new centers. Other transfers were overtly punitive. Thus, after bringing the Sarmisii under his control, Philip "led them off to Macedonia, ten thousand of them" (Polyaenus 4.2.12). We may note, too, the case of Philippopolis in Thrace. According to Theopompus (<hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 115 F110) Philip established this city, nicknamed "Poneropolis," by populating it with criminals, sycophants, and false witnesses. Allowing for hyperbole, Theopompus' remarks suggest that the establishment of the city was intended to deal with social problems elsewhere. Of course this was precisely the kind of program Isocrates was recommending for ridding Greece of <hi rend="italic">its</hi> social ills.</p>
               <p>In his colonization program, as in so much else, Alexander was influenced by Philip.<ref target="fnd0e3001" type="fnoteref">5</ref> But the situation facing Alexander was quite different from that which had confronted Philip. Not surprisingly Alexander's response differed in significant ways from his father's. Alexander's conquests took him thousands of miles from Macedonia. This distance from his homeland undoubtedly influenced both the policy he adopted toward the native populations he conquered and his colonization program. Given the vastness of his empire and the distance from Macedonia it made eminently good sense to avoid antagonizing his new subjects. As a matter of policy Alexander tried to cultivate the acquiescence and loyalty of the people he conquered. The difficulties in pacifying the eastern regions of his new empire made clear the need to foster such loyalty. The many anecdotes relating to Alexander's beneficent interest in the new <hi rend="italic">ethne</hi> he met and conquered attest not only to his tremendous curiosity but also to his skill as diplomat, politician, and strategist. Unlike his predecessors in the Middle East and Macedonia, he apparently avoided where possible the use of punitive deportations.<ref target="fnd0e3014" type="fnoteref">6</ref>

               <p>Just as distance from Europe affected the way Alexander treated the Asiatics, so it influenced his colonization program.

               <p>them, he could not simply move Macedonian civilians to new colonies as his father had done. It made better sense, logistically, to use retired soldiers as colonists. They were, after all, in the area, and they were of proven loyalty. It was, however, more than distance that prevented Alexander from bringing over Macedonian civilians for his new settlements: in his short life Alexander was constantly preoccupied with the conquest and pacification of his new empire. Diodorus claims that among the <hi rend="italic"> hypomnemata</hi> found after Alexander's death, one item indicated that he had planned "to found cities and to transfer populations from Asia to Europe and in the opposite direction from Europe to Asia in order to bring the largest continents to community and to the friendship of kinsmen by intermarriage and friendly ties" (18.4.4).<ref target="fnd0e3041" type="fnoteref">7</ref> Irrespective of whether this controversial document is authentic or not, it is conceivable that under peaceful conditions Alexander would have wanted to undertake such a program. But the distances involved would have made the enterprise daunting even under the best of circumstances. We know from at least one other source that it was quite difficult to transplant settlers. When Antiochos III moved the two thousand Jewish families from Mesopotamia and Babylonia to Lydia and Phrygia he specifically alluded to the fact that the move would be difficult (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00029.gif"/> (Joseph. <hi rend="italic">AJ</hi> 12.150). Presumably, the king was referring to logistical problems or the reluctance of the Jews to go. Alexander would have faced the same difficulties bringing civilian settlers from Europe to regions east of the Tigris. It will not be surprising therefore if Alexander, preoccupied as he was by military operations and security concerns, did not undertake any population transfer of this type. In fact he did not have to do this because he had already effected a population transfer of far greater proportions by virtue of the Greek and Macedonian soldiers who had followed him and whom he continued to bring to Asia. These were the ones he settled in his colonies. Alexander's colonizing activity corresponded to the advice Isocrates gave Philip, but not in the region the orator had suggested. The latter, of course, was thinking of Asia Minor. By the time Alexander implemented his own colonization program he had moved well beyond Asia Minor. I have already mentioned that nearly all of Alexander's colonies were east of the Tigris. W. W. Tarn believes that "the reason is obvious." As he explains it, "between the Aegean and the Tigris he had plenty of existing cities, Greek, Phoenician, Syrian, Babylonian; between the Tigris and India hardly a couple."<ref target="fnd0e3054" type="fnoteref">8</ref> Tarn is quite correct about the relative scarcity of</p>

               <p>cities east of the Tigris. But geographic determinism is hardly the whole explanation. After all, the Seleucids later ruled vast stretches of territory in both Asia and Asia Minor and found occasion to establish settlements throughout their empire, both west and east of the Tigris.</p>
               <p>It was after his second great victory over the Persians, at Issos in 333 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , that Alexander began founding settlements. The battle of Issos represents a major turning point in Alexander's march of conquest. Up to this time he could claim recognition as King of Macedonia and Hegemon of the League of Corinth. In his initial correspondence with King Darius after Issos Alexander rehearsed Darius' "crimes" and ordered that in future he was to be addressed as "King of Asia" (Arr. <hi rend="italic"> Anab</hi> . 2.14.9). Of course Alexander had not yet conquered all of Asia. But the vigorous self-confidence in the claim to the title translated itself into action. It was now, as claimant to the rule of Asia, that Alexander began building settlements. And just as his father had founded eponymous cities, so he founded Alexandreia in Egypt, the first of many settlements with that name.<ref target="fnd0e3081" type="fnoteref">9</ref> What began after Issos when Alexander called himself de facto "King of Asia" continued after Gaugamela and the death of Darius when de jure he became "King of Asia." Alexander's treatment of Ilion may serve as one example of the new situation created by the conquest of the Persian Empire. According to Strabo (13.1.26), immediately after the battle of the Granikos River in 334 Alexander made various benefactions to Ilion (on which see below). But it was only after the "overthrow of the Persians" that Alexander wrote to Ilion and promised to make it a "great city." Not surprisingly, it was also after the "overthrow of the Persians," when Alexander was transformed from conqueror to ruler, that he began in earnest to found settlements throughout his newly won kingdom.</p>
               <p>Every colony served some specific purpose—be it to pacify an area, guard a road, or garrison a frontier region. And practically every colony had the same official name, Alexandreia. The use of this toponym was a master stroke of propaganda. It served as a constant reminder to the inhabitants of the particular region of the royal presence, and it bound the colonists more closely to the king. Of course, it also served as a reminder of the greatness and extent of Alexander's power. Not surprisingly, Alexander's successors made extensive use of family eponyms when founding their settlements.</p>
               <p>Alexander's influence on the age that followed his reign cannot be overstated. He not only brought the whole Persian Empire under Greco-</p>

               <p>Macedonian rule and bequeathed it to his successors; he also established the model for Hellenistic kingship. And one of the activities a Hellenistic king undertook was the establishment of new settlements. While the Successors were emulating Alexander they were incidentally competing with each other. And just as Alexander founded settlements throughout his empire, so his successors did likewise in the kingdoms they inherited. In the generation after Alexander's death there was a very strong tendency for all the Successors to act in unison. What one did, all did; what one avoided, all avoided. In 306, for example, after the battle of Salamis, Antigonos and Demetrios assumed the title "king." Not to be outdone, the other Diadochoi "out of jealousy" (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00030.gif"/>, Diod. 20.53.4) similarly took the title at this time. A consideration of the marriages contracted by the various Diadochoi reveals the same tendency. In the years before the battle of Ipsos they avoided marriages with each other. Immediately after, with the changed international situation brought about by the death of Antigonos and the disintegration of his empire, the Diadochoi ventured into a veritable frenzy of marriages. Seleukos married Demetrios' daughter Stratonike; Ptolemy gave one daughter, Arsinoe, to Lysimachos, another daughter, Theoxena, to Agathokles of Syracuse, a third, Ptolemais, to Demetrios, and a fourth, Lysandra, to Kassandros' son Alexander. Meanwhile another son of Kassandros, Antipater, married Lysimachos' daughter, Eurydike, and Pyrrhos married Antigone, Berenike's daughter by Philippos.<ref target="fnd0e3109" type="fnoteref">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>It comes as no surprise then that all the Diadochoi founded settlements. The earliest, incidentally, were established even before the Successors took the title of "king." Kassandros was apparently the first, building KASSANDREIA and probably THESSALONIKE as well, in 316 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> The latter toponym is interesting. Kassandros named the settlement, of course, in honor of his wife, who was a daughter of Philip II. As a claimant to the Macedonian throne he was surely aware of the propaganda value of following the lead of Philip and Alexander in founding cities and then advertising his tie to them by the name of one of his cities.<ref target="fnd0e3122" type="fnoteref">11</ref> In 316 Kassandros also rebuilt Boeotian THEBES, which had been destroyed by Alexander the Great, and shortly after encouraged Acarnanians to move from their unfortified villages to larger, protected cities (Diod. 19.67.4). Lysimachos founded LYSIMACHEIA in 309, and Antigonos in the years before his death at Ipsos had an active career as a colonizer.</p>

               <p>The royal tradition of settlement founding and refounding continued with succeeding generations. However, it was more than just tradition that impelled Hellenistic monarchs and dynasts to found colonies.<ref target="fnd0e3152" type="fnoteref">12</ref> Colonization programs answered military and security, as well as economic and political, needs (see below, "The Purpose of the Settlements"). It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the successors of the Diadochoi also founded large numbers of settlements.</p>
               <p>Discussions of colonization by Alexander's successors tend to concentrate on the Seleucid achievements.<ref target="fnd0e3156" type="fnoteref">13</ref> This is understandable. The Seleucid empire was vast, by far the largest of the successor states. And the Seleucids, especially Seleukos I as well as Antiochos I and II, were vigorous colonizers. But they were not the only Hellenistic rulers to found colonies. As I have already mentioned, Antigonos I Monophthalmos was also an energetic builder. It is well to recall for example that at least three major Hellenistic foundations—ALEXANDREIA Troas, NIKAIA, and Antioch on the Orontes—had originally been founded as Antigoneias. And in fact a number of scholars have argued that Antigonos effectively anticipated much of the great colonizing work of Seleukos.<ref target="fnd0e3163" type="fnoteref">14</ref> Antigonos' successors, especially Demetrios Poliorketes and Philip V, continued the pattern he set. More or less contemporary with Antigonos Monophthalmos were Kassandros and Lysimachos, both of whom took an active role in founding settlements. I have already referred to Kassandros' foundations. Lysimachos' settlements included LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, ALEXANDREIA Troas, NIKAIA, ARSINOE Ephesos, and EURYDIKEIA Smyrna. The Attalids, of course, established colonies in the area they ruled.<ref target="fnd0e3176" type="fnoteref">15</ref> Their foundations included STRATONIKEIA (possibly) and PHILADELPHEIA in Lydia, DIONYSOPOLIS and EUMENEIA in Phrygia, and ATTALEIA in Pamphylia. Reflecting their strength as a naval power, the Ptolemies established numerous colonies in harbors and port cities throughout the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean.<ref target="fnd0e3185" type="fnoteref">16</ref> It was not, however, just the successor kings to Alexander who were colonizers. Lesser known dynasts, such as Pleistarchos and the Lysias/Philomelos family established colonies, as did the Bithynian, Pontic, and other semi-Hellenized kings. In short, settlement</p>

               <p>founding was actively and widely pursued by all the Hellenistic kings and dynasts.</p>
               <p>It is interesting to note that the earliest datable settlements of the Successors were in Europe, not Asia Minor or Asia, and they did not involve population transfer. Rather, both KASSANDREIA and THESSALONIKE as well as LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace resulted from synoecism, a traditional Greek method for founding poleis and one that was subsequently widely used in Asia Minor by other monarchs. Frequently ancient authors will specify that a particular place had resulted from a synoecism. Similarly inscriptions will occasionally make reference to a <hi rend="italic">synoikismos</hi> . It is well to recall, therefore, that the term could be used to describe a number of different processes. For example, it could refer to the political unification of various towns with or without the inhabitants actually moving. In other cases it could be used to describe the repopulation of a city with former inhabitants who had scattered or fled.<ref target="fnd0e3225" type="fnoteref">17</ref>
               </p>
               <p>These early settlements were founded, as I have said, in the late fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> The time frame for Hellenistic colony foundings runs from this point to the beginning of the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Within that period each of the dynasties was active at particular times. Antigonid colonizing began at the end of the fourth century with Antigonos Monophthalmos and continued at a slower pace under his successors down to Philip V. The great age of Seleucid colonization also began at the end of the fourth century and extended to the middle of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> —the period coterminous with the greatest vigor and stability of the family. Certainly Seleucid kings founded settlements after this time, but the number of new colonies declined and the nature of the undertaking changed. For example, we can ascribe definitely or tentatively—at least thirteen settlements in Asia Minor to Antiochos I. The available evidence indicates that many of these were settled by Macedonians or Greeks. In contrast, we can credit Antiochos III with only five. At LYSIMACHEIA he did undertake a major program to rebuild a city that had been destroyed and abandoned. On the other hand, at SARDIS and AMYZON his work was limited to urban rehabilitation. Finally, for two, the JEWISH COLONIES in Lydia and Phrygia and the KARDAKIAN KOME in Lycia (possibly a colony of his), Antiochos HI used Asiatics. Antiochos IV probably founded fewer colonies than has generally been believed. And those foundations that may be ascribed to him were in all likelihood little more than formal renamings.<ref target="fnd0e3229" type="fnoteref">18</ref> The bulk of Ptolemaic colonizing activity took place in the first half of the</p>

               <p>In the Hellenistic period the center of gravity of the Greek world shifted from Greece to the Middle East. By the end of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Sparta was already in decline, Thebes had had its brief moment in the sun, and Athens after the Lamian War moved swiftly off the center stage. In the generation that followed, Athens became what it would remain until the end of antiquity: a respected university town, visited by persons of culture and decorated by sentimental Hellenistic monarchs and autocrats. But it was no longer a world power. That status had passed to the Hellenistic monarchies, as had much of the wealth of the new age.</p>
               <p>A great constitutional difficulty for the Hellenistic world was the relationship of the new monarchies to the poleis, both the old and the recently established ones. Except in vestigial form monarchy did not exist in most of classical Greece. As a result there was no civic tradition in Greece that took into account the relationship of the polis to the monarch.<ref target="fnd0e3267" type="fnoteref">19</ref> In Greek political tradition a hallmark of the polis was that it was—theoretically—<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00031.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00032.gif"/>, free and independent. Greek concern on this point can be seen quite vividly in the invitation the Athenians extended in 377 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> to cities to join the Second Athenian League. The Athenians, sensitive after their abuse of the allies in the fifth century, specified in the invitation that each allied city was to be "free and autonomous, using whatever form of government it wants, receiving neither a garrison nor an [Athenian] governor</p>

               <p>nor paying tribute."<ref target="fnd0e3325" type="fnoteref">20</ref> Ideally these were the conditions under which a completely free city could exist; these conditions were obviously incompatible with the centralized control of a Hellenistic kingdom. In fact, one of the great polarities of the Hellenistic monarchies was the tension between the Greek tradition of the independent polis and the central control that could be exerted by the king. This tension can be seen dearly, for example, in the actions of Antigonos Monophthalmos who publicly assured cities under his rule of their "freedom and autonomy" and then proceeded to impose his dictates when necessary.<ref target="fnd0e3335" type="fnoteref">21</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in 311 B.C.  Antigonos proglaimed his readiness to preserve the freedom and autonomy of the Greeks.  This intention is preserved in a letter Antigonos sent to the city of Skepsis in the Troad announcing the peace that had just been concluded with Kassandros, Lysimachos, and Ptolemy (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 1.2, 55, 61).  In fact, the subsequent experience of Skepsis may serve as an example of the problem facing king and city. In the same year Skepsis voted to set up a cult image and to establish divine honors for Antigonos.  The inscription recording this decree also mentions an earlier festival for Antigonos, presumably also involving divine honors (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 6.10-35).  The honors voted in 311 B.C. were in gratitude for the recent peace and guarantee of autonomy and freedom. It is instructive—and sobering—to follow the next step in the  history of Skepsis. A few years later Antigonos forced its population to join his foundation of Antigoneia Troas (Strabo 13.1.33); SO much for "freedom and autonomy." This short excursus on Skepsis' history brings into focus a number of points: the desire by the king to appear as a champion of the freedom of the Greeks, the desire of the city to reciprocate this benefaction, and, finally, the king's ability to override this freedom when he chose. Let us consider these points briefly as they relate to the new poleis.</p>
               <p>Antigonos and his son, Demetrios, were masters of public relations. Unlike Antipater and his son, Kassandros, Antigonos followed Alexander in professing concern for the freedom of the Greek cities. I will not enter here into a discussion of the sincerity of this concern. Rather I would point out that the public relations campaign was one aspect of a larger effort by all the kings to lavish benefactions—in the form of both civic grants and material gifts—on both the old and the new cities in their respective empires and beyond.

               <p>efforts advertised to the Hellenistic word the kings' philhellenism and made visible to the Greco-Macedonian settlers the royal concern for their welfare and loyalty. As in so many other areas, here too Alexander set the standard. Immediately after his victory at the battle of the Granikos River Alexander visited ILION. According to Strabo (13.1.26) he decorated the temple with offerings, bestowed on the city the title "polis," gave orders to improve the city with buildings, and determined it would be free and exempt from tribute. After the "overthrow of the Persians" he sent a letter to Ilion promising to make it a "great polis," to build a notable sanctuary, and to proclaim sacred games.</p>
               <p>Alexander did not live to carry out all these plans. Nevertheless, Strabo's lists may serve as a useful illustration of the types of benefits a city could expect. The example set by Alexander was in fact followed by his successors and in this way developed the tradition of Hellenistic kings and queens as benefactors and patrons.<ref target="fnd0e3362" type="fnoteref">22</ref> A good indication of the importance attached to public benefaction by the Hellenistic kings can be seen in the fact that after an earthquake devastated Rhodes in 228/7, it received contributions from Hieron and Gelon, Ptolemy III, Antigonos Doson, Seleukos III, Prousias I, and Mithridates II, as well as Lysanias, Olympichos, and Limnaios (Polyb. 5.88-90.4).<ref target="fnd0e3405" type="fnoteref">23</ref> The attention paid to Rhodes calls to mind the numerous urban rehabilitation projects undertaken by the various monarchs. These could, for example, involve cities that had been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable by war or natural causes. I have already mentioned Kassandros' rebuilding of THEBE. Prousias I did the same for Kios and renamed it for himself. Antiochos III rebuilt the abandoned</p>

               <p>LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace and was responsible for restoring sections of SARDIS and AMYZON.</p>
               <p>Royal benefactions were also showered on the new settlements, often at the time of their founding. This happened, for example, at THEBES, LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, APOLLONIS, SARDIS, EUPATORIA Amisos, and the JEWISH COLONIES in Lydia and Phrygia. It was undoubtedly in connection with the founding of DEMETRIAS Sikyon that Demetrios Poliorketes' mistress, Lamia, gave a painted stoa to the city. According to Strabo, "the kings" (unidentified) "adorned Stratonikeia [i.e., in Caria] with expensive buildings" (14.2.25), and another unidentified king wrote to NYSA in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> that he would give it "all the other benefactions (<hi rend="italic">philanthropa</hi> ) and honors (<hi rend="italic">teimia</hi> ) which the kings before us granted" (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 64.13). Eumenes II and other Attalid kings lavished much attention on Pergamon (Strabo 13.4.1-2). The libraries at PERGAMON and Alexandreia are excellent examples of Hellenistic royal patronage.<ref target="fnd0e3455" type="fnoteref">24</ref> But if a king could give, he could take away. I have already mentioned that Antiochos IV was generous in giving gifts to cities. He was also generous in giving cities as gifts. According to the author of 2 Maccabees (4.30-31) Antiochos gave ANTIOCH on the Kydnos and Mallos as a gift to his mistress. In both cities this gift caused riots that could be quelled only by the king's presence! Finally, we may expect that gifts were often given with strings—-overtly or covertly—attached. Polybius, for example, describes (22.7-8) how King Eumenes wanted to give the Achaeans 125 talents. The interest from this was to be used to pay the Achaean council. We are told that Apollonides of Sikyon, among others, vigorously opposed Eumenes' gift on the grounds that it would allow the Attalid king to interfere in the affairs of the League. Ultimately the Achaeans decided not to accept the gift, though Polybius adds that its magnitude made it "hard to resist"!</p>
               <p>In addition to material gifts, kings made numerous grants of civic benefits to cities. For example, Demetrios Poliorketes reestablished <hi rend="italic">eleutheria</hi> , (freedom) for DEMETRIAS Sikyon, and King Antiochos promised to guard LYSIMACHEIA's [autonomy], democracy, to keep it ungarrisoned and [<hi rend="italic">aphorologeros</hi> ]. In Asia Minor fragmentary inscriptions indicate SELEUKEIA Tralleis was receiving privileges, including some kind of relief, probably from Antiochos III. Seleukos I and Antiochos I granted NYSA the right to be <hi rend="italic">asylos</hi> , while another king whose name is lost confirmed it in <hi rend="italic">hikesia</hi> (the right to receive suppliants), <hi rend="italic"> asylia</hi> , and <hi rend="italic">ateleia</hi> (tax exemption), rights that "[had been previously granted</p>

               <p>The cities reciprocated this beneficent attention with demonstrations of goodwill. These demonstrations could take a number of forms, depending on the benefactors and the magnitude of the gift. Cities could vote, among other things, a decree of praise, free meals, <hi rend="italic">proedria</hi> at games, citizenship, or <hi rend="italic"> ateleia</hi> . Such honors were liberally given to prominent and generous individuals. For example, APOLLONIA Salbake granted citizen rights, <hi rend="italic">ateleia</hi> , and <hi rend="italic">proedria</hi> to the Seleucid hipparch stationed there. But the greatest honor a Hellenistic city could give—normally reserved for a ruler and, occasionally, his wife—was the establishment of a cult. While civic cults first appeared at the end of the Peloponnesian War when Samos established one for Lysander, the phenomenon proliferated under Alexander and during the Hellenistic period.<ref target="fnd0e3546" type="fnoteref">26</ref> The spread of civic cults in fact coincides with the decline of the independence of the polis in the age of monarchy. At the same time the cults reflect the historical importance and centrality of religion in the classical polis. Cults and the public festivals of civic deities, such as Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus at Athens, were as commonly found in Greece as were hero cults and founder cults.<ref target="fnd0e3559" type="fnoteref">27</ref> In discussing the creation of new political subdivisions in his Cretan city, Plato specifies that each section was to be assigned a god or daimon, or at least a hero (<hi rend="italic">Leg</hi> . 738D).<ref target="fnd0e3584" type="fnoteref">28</ref> The new political reality for poleis created by the establishment of the Hellenistic monarchies likewise necessitated the creation of new cults.

               <p>Many of the Greek cities of western Asia Minor, among them ILION and PRIENE, established cults in honor of Alexander the Great.<ref target="fnd0e3608" type="fnoteref">29</ref> The practice continued after his death and spread.<ref target="fnd0e3645" type="fnoteref">30</ref> Cults for the various rulers, frequently as founders, were set up in many of the Hellenistic settlements. We find such evidence at KASSANDREIA, DEMETRIAS in Thessaly, DEMETRIAS Sikyon, ILION, PERGAMON, KOLOPHON, ARSINOE Ephesos, SARDIS, NYSA, ANTIOCH on the Maeander, APOLLONIA Salbake, APAMEIA Kelainai, HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia, LAODIKEIA on the Lykos, EUMENEIA, APOLLONIA in Phrygia, ARSINOE in Cilicia, and PROUSIAS on the Hypios. There is abundant evidence from the early Hellenistic period indicating that such cults were frequently established in gratitude for royal favor. This was the case, for example, at ILION, the Ionian League, Smyrna, and Teos.<ref target="fnd0e3667" type="fnoteref">31</ref> The inscriptions from Smyrna and Teos give a rather full explanation of the circumstances underlying the establishment of the cult. The preamble of the Smyrna decree regarding Seleukos II begins: "Resolved by the people, the proposal of the generals. Since previously at the time when King Seleukos (II) crossed over to Seleukis and many great dangers surrounded our city and territory, the people maintained its goodwill and friendship toward him, neither being frightened by the attack of the enemy nor caring about the destruction of its property, but considering everything to be secondary to continuing in its policy and to keeping a share in (the King's) interests to the best of its ability just as it promised at first; and wherefore King Seleukos, showing piety toward the gods and affection toward his parents, being generous and knowing how to return favors to his benefactors, honored our city because of the goodwill of the people and the ambitions it displayed for his interests and because of the establishment of the cult of his father Antiochos Theos and his father's mother Stratonike Thea in our city in which they are given remarkable honors publicly by the people and privately by each of the citizens and he guaranteed</p>

Previously, when staying in the region beyond the Tauros, he was the cause of many benefits to us; when he came to our region he settled affairs in an advantageous way, and when he stayed in our city he saw that we were exhausted both in our public and our private affairs because of the continuous wars and the great burden of contributions we were bearing. Wishing to display piety towards the gods to whom he consecrated our city and territory, and wanting to do a favour to the people and the association of Dionysiac artists, he came forward in person in the assembly and granted to our city and territory (to be) holy <hi rend="italic">(hiera)</hi> , inviolate <hi rend="italic">(asylos)</hi> and free from tribute <hi rend="italic">(aphorologetos)</hi> and undertook to free us himself from the other contributions we pay to King Attalos (I) so that by bringing about an improvement in the city's fortunes he would receive the rifle not only of benefactor of the people, but of its saviour. He stayed in the city with his friends and the military forces which accompanied him, and gave ample evidence of the good faith he already shows towards all men, and after this has constantly been responsible for many favours to us, thereby giving an example to all the Greeks of how he treats those who are his benefactors and who are well disposed towards him; some of the blessings which resulted in prosperity for our city he is now bringing about, while others he will bring about in future. He wrote a letter to the people in which he suggested the sending of an embassy [to him] to discuss the matters he said he was convinced would [benefit] the people as well, and when the people sent as ambassadors Dionysios son of Apollo ... Hermagoras son of Epimenes, Theodoros son of Zopyros, he declared to them [that] he had freed the city for all time as he had promised of the tributes which we paid to King Attalos. Concerning these matters he sent a letter in which he said he had instructed the ambassadors to report to us, and the ambassadors reported these matters [to the people]. In the same way his sister and queen Laodice constantly shares the same view as the king in [all circumstances] ... and in good deeds towards the city she shows [herself] eager and zealous to perform benefactions, and the people has received the greatest [blessings] from both of them. Therefore, so that we may be seen in every [circumstance] to be returning adequate thanks to the king and to the queen and to be surpassing ourselves in the honours paid to</p>

It was in fact a common occurrence for cities to point out in decrees that they knew how to repay benefactors. For example, the preamble of the Athenian decree for Kallias of Sphettos includes the statement "therefore so that all who wish to show zeal towards the city may know that the people always remember those who have benefited it and repay thanks to everyone of them... "<ref target="fnd0e3749" type="fnoteref">33</ref> It was obviously important for cities to demonstrate their appreciation of royal benefactions, just as it was important for the monarchs to show their appreciation of civic goodwill. This mutual need smoothed over the potentially difficult situation created by the exercise of centralized authority over the poleis. After all, the Hellenistic kingdoms outside of Macedonia were personal rather than national monarchies, held as spear-won territories. As Diodorus writes (19.105.4), these kingdoms consisted of <hi rend="italic">ethne</hi> and poleis. The kings ruled empires planted in foreign lands that had large components of <hi rend="italic">ethne</hi> . The <hi rend="italic">ethne</hi> were the native substratum in which the new Greco-Macedonian poleis existed. Above all else the kings needed the loyalty and the support of the Greco-Macedonians if they were to maintain their hold on the throne. The Teos decree makes this quite clear. Having elucidated the benefactions Antiochos III had bestowed on it, the decree of Teos explains that this gives "an example to <hi rend="italic">all the Greeks</hi> of how he treats those who are his benefactors and who are well disposed towards him" (emphasis mine).<ref target="fnd0e3756" type="fnoteref">34</ref> The ruler cult provided a concrete means whereby the poleis could publicly acknowledge their benefactors. And their benefactors were always happy to be recognized. But all the benefactions and diplomatic courtesies could not hide the hard fact that power ultimately lay with the ruler, not the polis. Ruler cult was a partial solution at best for the problems the cities faced.</p>

               <div3 type="ss2" id="d0e1634">
                  <head rend="Heading-Heading4">Europe</head>
                  <p>When Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">De Alex. fort</hi> . I.328E), Ammianus Marcellinus (14.8.6), and Libanius (<hi rend="italic">Or</hi> . 11.101) discussed the achievement of Alexander and the Seleucids in founding settlements they were clearly thinking primarily of Asia. Certainly one would have to grant that the most dramatic results of their work were in that part of the world. In this region extended contacts between the native population and Greeks and Macedonians first occurred as a result of Alexander's conquests. The contrast in the demographic picture before and after the advent of the Macedonian was overwhelming. According to Plutarch, "by founding more than seventy cities among the barbarian tribes and by spreading Greek magistracies over Asia, Alexander overcame its wild and uncivilized way of life." Plutarch's encomium for Alexander later found an echo in Libanius' praise for Seleukos I Nikator as a colonizer of Asia. Nevertheless we should not forget that there were Hellenistic settlements established in Europe as well and, as far as we know, that some of the earliest foundations of the Diadochoi were built there. I have already mentioned that some of these settlements resulted from synoecisms. Other settlements were refounded older towns. Not surprisingly, there is no firm evidence in Macedonia or Greece for military colonies of the type found in central Anatolia. They would hardly have been needed in Macedonia or tolerated in Greece.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Epirus, Illyria, and Thrace</hi> . Epirus, Illyria, and Thrace were on the periphery of the Greek and Macedonian world. The Macedonian expansion toward these regions in the latter part of the fourth century resulted in the building of a number of foundations. Many of the Hellenistic settlements there as well as in Macedonia and Thessaly were located on north-south routes running from the Danube region to central and southern Greece.</p>
                  <p>While not a direct possession of Alexander, Epirus came under Kassandros' rule around 314 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C</hi> . Subsequently it passed to Pyrrhos. The former founded ANTIPATREIA in southern Illyria, and the latter established ANTIGONEIA in Epirus. Both settlements were strategically located. Livy (31.27.1) described Antipatreia as a fortified city in a narrow pass. Antigoneia overlooked the gorge of the Drin River, which was the main route from north into central Epirus.</p>
                  <p>I have already mentioned the pacification program of Thrace that was undertaken by Philip II and his use of population transfers and colony foundings</p>
                  <pb id="JD_Page_32" n="32"/>
                  <p>for this purpose. In 340 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> his son built ALEXANDROPOLIS after subduing a rebellion of the tribe of the Maidoi. The most important Hellenistic settlement in Thrace was LYSIMACHEIA. According to Appian (<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 1) it was built in 309 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> as a bulwark against the Thracians. Subsequently it was destroyed by the Thracians. Nevertheless the importance of its location was such that Antiochos III decided to rebuild it in 196 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> as a residence for his son.</p>
                  <p>According to the Adoulis inscription (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 54) Ptolemy III Euergetes I included Thrace and the Hellespont among his conquests. Polybius (5.34.7-8) mentions that at the accession of Ptolemy IV Philopator the Egyptians held the main points of the Asia Minor coast from Pamphylia to the Hellespont, including places around LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, Ainos, and Maroneia. Polybius notes that this gave the Ptolemies strong influence over the affairs of Thrace and Macedonia.<ref target="fnd0e3840" type="fnoteref">35</ref> Despite this there is no evidence that the Ptolemies established any colonies in Thrace.</p>
                  <p>After the defeat of Antiochos III at the battle of Magnesia Eumenes II received Antiochos' European possessions. These included Lysimacheia and the Thracian Chersonese as well as points on the north shore of the Propontis (Polyb. 21.45.9), among which was PANION.<ref target="fnd0e3847" type="fnoteref">36</ref> Evidence for an Attalid colony at Panion can be seen in five honorific inscriptions for Attalid kings that have been discovered there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Macedonia</hi> . After the death of Alexander, Antipater remained in control of Macedon. Following his death in 319 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> his son, Kassandros, ultimately succeeded him. Married to Alexander's half sister, Thessalonike, Kassandros emulated him by founding new settlements with dynastic names. Kassandros, in fact, was the first of Alexander's successors to do this. In 316 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> he founded by synoecism the city of KASSANDREIA and began the rebuilding of THEBES in Boeotia. Probably around the same time he built, also by synoecism, THESSALONIKE. HIS example was soon followed by the other Diadochoi.</p>
                  <p>The Antigonid rulers were also active founding colonies in Macedonia and in Thessaly. In Macedonia, for example, we encounter ANTIGONEIAS in Chalcidice and in Paeonia, DEMETRIAS, PERSEIS, PHILA, and STRATONIKEIA. While the exact location of many of these settlements cannot be specified, it is quite probable that many of them were located at strategically important sites. For instance, ANTIGONEIA in Paeonia was on the Axios River on the road from Stobi to Thessalonike (Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.34 and <hi rend="italic">Tab. Peut</hi> . VIII.5).</p>

                  <p>The so-called Iron Gate of the middle valley of the Axios was a gorge that provided the easiest access from the lands of the Danube into Macedonia. It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that ANTIGONEIA was located in this general area.<ref target="fnd0e3879" type="fnoteref">37</ref> Similarly, PHILA occupied an important site at the northern entrance to the Vale of Tempe. Finally, I might mention Aristotle's native town, Stageira, which was destroyed along with Olynthos by Philip II in 348 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> It was subsequently restored, probably by Philip himself. Tradition also recorded that he did this at the urging of his son and out of respect for the latter's teacher, Aristotle.<ref target="fnd0e3889" type="fnoteref">38</ref>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Thessaly and Aetolia</hi> . The most important Hellenistic settlement in Thessaly was DEMETRIAS. Like KASSANDREIA and THESSALONIKE, it was established by synoecism. The founder was Demetrios Poliorketes. Its location should be noted. Not only did it dominate the southern access to the Vale of Tempe, it was a coastal city with a harbor: despite his conquest of Macedonia Demetrios was still very concerned about supporting the Antigonid navy in the Aegean. Furthermore, together with Chalkis and Korinth it was considered to be one of the "fetters of Greece" (Strabo 9.4. 15; Livy 32.37.3; Polyb. 18.11.4-7). Control of these cities, along with Piraeus when possible, gave the Antigonids control over central and southern Greece. It also helped prevent the Ptolemies from establishing themselves there. Other Antigonid settlements in Thessaly included OLYMPIAS, the refounded fortress-village of Gonnokondylon, PHILIPPOPOLIS Gomphoi, which guarded two of the passes from Epirus into Thessaly, and Phthiotic Thebes, the Aetolian stronghold that had been threatening Philip V's communication with the south. Philip captured the latter place in 217 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and refounded it as a PHILIPPOPOLIS.</p>
                  <p>In Aetolia there were four cities that should be noted—ARSINOE Konope, LYSIMACHEIA, PTOLEMAIS, and ATTALEIA. The first will have been named for Arsinoe (the wife of Lysimachos and, later, of Ptolemy II Philadelphos), the</p>

                     <p> The circumstances of the rebuilding of Stageira are variously reported in the sources. According to Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">Alex</hi> . 7.2) Philip himself restored the city. Elsewhere, however, Plutarch says Aristotle refounded the city (<hi rend="italic">Mor</hi> . 1097B and 1126F). In fact Aristotle's name is frequently found in connection with the rebuilding of Stageira. Other sources, for example, mention Aristotle's role in interceding with Philip or asking Alexander to do this (D.L. 5.4). Dio Chrysostom remarks (47.9) that it was said of Aristotle that he alone had the good fortune to be the founder of his own fatherland. The <hi rend="italic">Vita Aristotelis Marciana</hi> (83-87, ed. O. Gigon) adds that in gratitude the Stageirites established a festival, the Aristoteleia, and named one of their months after the philosopher.

                  <p>second for Lysimachos, the third for Ptolemy III Euergetes I, and the fourth for Attalos I. The founders are not definitely known. However, since the settlements were in Aetolian territory, I do not think they were built by Arsinoe, Lysimachos, Ptolemy, or Attalos. Hellenistic rulers did not normally establish settlements in regions they did not rule. Furthermore it is hardly likely the host state would have allowed it. Rather I believe these settlements were named by the Aetolians to honor allied monarchs. This, too, was somewhat unusual but not completely out of character for the diplomatically adroit Aetolians.<ref target="fnd0e3939" type="fnoteref">39</ref>

                     <hi rend="italic">The Peloponnese</hi> . Settlement building south of Thessaly was limited. Those sections of central and southern Greece that were under Macedonian hegemony were usually controlled by garrisons rather than settlements.<ref target="fnd0e3949" type="fnoteref">40</ref> In fact the only Macedonian foundation south of Thessaly was DEMETRIAS, Poliorketes' refoundation of Sikyon. The capture of Mantineia in 223 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> by the Achaeans with the help of Antigonos Doson was followed by the enslavement of its population and the distribution of its wealth to the conquerors. Subsequently the Achaeans refounded it as ANTIGONEIA. Finally, Methana was refounded as ARSINOE, most probably by Arsinoe II Philadelphos. The latter represents our only known example of a Ptolemaic foundation on the mainland of Greece. The important docking facilities make clear that its primary function was to service the Egyptian fleet in the Aegean.<ref target="fnd0e3959" type="fnoteref">41</ref>

                  <p>The Ptolemies first gained control of Cyprus in 311/10 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , lost it to Demetrios Poliorketes in 306, and retook it permanently in 294.<ref target="fnd0e4010" type="fnoteref">43</ref> Cyprus is strategically located in the eastern Mediterranean, facing both the south coast of Asia Minor and the north coast of Syria. As such it commanded the shipping lanes between Egypt, these areas, and the Aegean. Control of it was obviously vital if the Ptolemies were to extend their empire beyond Egypt. Cyprus also played a major role in Ptolemaic strategic planning. It was a major source for timber and a key center for Ptolemaic shipbuilding.<ref target="fnd0e4020" type="fnoteref">44</ref> In addition, it is well to recall that the Arsinoe settlements on Cyprus (and elsewhere) were harbors. In fact Cyprus was known in antiquity for its numerous harbors.<ref target="fnd0e4030" type="fnoteref">45</ref> Ammianus Marcellinus (14.8.14), for example, referred to it as an <hi rend="italic">insula portuosa</hi> . In short both the location and the resources of Cyprus contributed to its importance for the Ptolemies.</p>
                  <p>In the first half of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> the Egyptians controlled much of the Aegean, in particular the Cycladic islands. The instrument of control was the League of the Islanders, which the Ptolemies took over from Demetrios Poliorketes after 287 B.C. and which they held for the next generation. The Ptolemaic presence in the area is reflected in Arsinoes on Crete, on Keos, and on the Greek mainland at Methana in the Argolid.<ref target="fnd0e4037" type="fnoteref">46</ref> As was the case elsewhere, these Arsinoes were ports serving the needs of the Ptolemaic fleet and travelers. The utilitarian function of the Arsinoes is seen quite clearly in the case of ARSINOE Methana, where an agreement between it and Troizen makes extensive reference to the docking facilities (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> IV<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 76).

In c. 295 Demetrios lost control of this area to Seleukos I Nikator and Ptolemy I Soter. As a result the former took hold of most, if not all, of Cilicia, and the latter probably gained Pamphylia and Lycia.<ref target="fnd0e4090" type="fnoteref">47</ref> Lysimachos was defeated by Seleukos I and killed at the battle of Korupedion in 281. Seleukos now took control of most of Asia Minor. The Seleucid hold on Asia Minor was, however, far from complete; large parts of the subcontinent never actually came under their rule. Bithynia, Pontus, and Paphlagonia were effectively beyond their control, as was the area that became Galatia, Cappadocia, and much of the interior region of Pisidia. Furthermore, in the course of the third century Pergamon under Philetairos and his successors managed to slip out from under Seleucid rule. Finally, substantial sections of both the west and the south coast were, at various times, under Ptolemaic rule. Thus, in the third century a significant portion of Asia Minor was not under Seleucid control. What, then, was ruled by the Seleucids in the first half of the third century? The Troad, Aeolis and Mysia (with the exception of the slowly emerging Pergamon), parts of Ionia and Carla, Lydia and Phrygia, as well as Lycaonia and the border areas of Pisidia and some regions of the south coast, especially Cilicia. Seleucid control of Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains extended only through the reigns of Antiochos I and II, that is, until 246 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> This was also the period of greatest colonizing activity.</p>
                  <p>Antiochos II died in 246 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> He was succeeded by Seleukos II, during whose reign both the eastern and western extremities of the Seleucid empire disintegrated.

                  <p>was not until 213 that some degree of Seleucid control could be reasserted in the region. In that year Antiochos III finally overcame and executed another Seleucid usurper, Achaios, and thus brought the region under Seleucid hegemony. He also reconquered various coastal areas of Asia Minor in 197, but this was, likewise, to be temporary. His defeat at the hands of the Romans in 190 resulted in the permanent expulsion of the Seleucids from all of Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains. M. Cary has referred to the "Balkanization" of Asia Minor.<ref target="fnd0e4133" type="fnoteref">48</ref> Certainly this is an accurate characterization of the region after 246. In such an environment we should hardly expect to find the kings founding many colonies, if any at all. This was apparently the situation. At any rate our sources, spotty as they are, make no mention of it under Seleukos II or III. Under Antiochos III there was renewed colonizing activity, albeit on a far more modest scale than that seen under the first Seleucids.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">The Troad</hi> . The Troad was strategically important because it controlled not only the Hellespont but also the land route to Europe. In the generation of the Diadochoi both Antigonos Monophthalmos and Lysimachos gave particular attention to the cities of the Troad. Antigonos founded ANTIGONEIA Troas through a synoecism involving numerous surrounding towns. After the battle of Ipsos in 301 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Lysimachos refounded the city as an ALEXANDREIA. The commercial importance of Alexandreia is clear: it had the only good harbor on the west coast of the Troad. It was also important strategically to both Antigonos and Lysimachos because it assured a link between Macedonia and Asia Minor.<ref target="fnd0e4139" type="fnoteref">49</ref> ILION, as might be expected, was the object of universal attention. By the time Alexander reached it in 334 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> it was no longer a major urban center. Alexander had great plans for rebuilding it. What he actually did is not clear. In any event Antigonos may have founded the Federation of the Troad with its center at the temple of Athena in Ilion. It is also possible that he began the building of the temple.<ref target="fnd0e4149" type="fnoteref">50</ref> Lysimachos also took an active interest in Ilion. According to Strabo (13.1.26) Lysimachos actually built the temple of Athena. In addition he built a circuit wall and transferred the population of towns and villages in the vicinity to Ilion. Seleukos Nikator gained control of the Troad as a result of his victory at Korupedion in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> The region remained firmly in Seleucid hands until at least the middle of the century.

                  <p>and Parion.<ref target="fnd0e4214" type="fnoteref">51</ref> Further evidence for the Seleucids in the Troad can be seen in the famous series of inscriptions recording Antiochos I's gift of land to Aristodikides (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 10-13) and Antiochos II's sale of land to Laodike (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 18-20). Despite this evidence the only settlement in the Troad that can be attributed to the Seleucids with any degree of probability is ANTIOCH, the refounded Kebren. With the rise of Antiochos Hietax (c. 239 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ) the Troad passed from central Seleucid authority to the control of the usurper.</p>
                  <p>Apparently at some point in the second half of the third century all or some of the Troad came under temporary Ptolemaic domination. According to the Adoulis inscription (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 54.14-15) Ptolemy III Euergetes I claimed the Hellespont and Thrace as one of his conquests in the Third Syrian War (246-241 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ). Louis Robert has suggested that during the Ptolemaic presence in the Troad Larisa was refounded as a PTOLEMAIS.</p>
                  <p>In the latter part of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Attalos I maintained good relations with a number of cities in the Troad, among which were Lampsakos, ILION, and ALEXANDREIA Troas (Polyb. 5.78.6).<ref target="fnd0e4224" type="fnoteref">52</ref> We know of at least one Attalid settlement in the Troad, the <hi rend="italic">katoikia</hi> of the AIGOSAOES.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Mysia and Aeolis</hi> . According to Stephanos (s.v. "Antigoneia") there was an ANTIGONEIA that was a "fortress" of the Kyzikene and was fifty stades from the "Western Sea." While the location is not precisely known, it is likely that it was in Mysia. R. A. Billows has suggested that Antigonos Monophthalmos founded this colony and three other ANTIGONEIAS (the later Alexandreia Troas, near Daskyleion, and Nikaia) in order to control the region after the rebellion of Phoinix in 310 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> and, possibly, to counter Lysimachos' new settlement of LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace.<ref target="fnd0e4231" type="fnoteref">53</ref> It is probable that Lysimachos also founded a LYSIMACHEIA on the coast of Aeolis. However, other than Pliny's reference to it (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.122) we know nothing else about the settlement.</p>
                  <p>After the battle of Korupedion the Seleucids took control of Mysia and Aeolis. Evidence for their presence in Aeolis can be seen in the purchase by the town of Pitane of some land on the Gulf of Adramyttion from Antiochos I (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 335. 135f. = <hi rend="italic">SEG</hi> IV.68o). The purchase price was apparently quite high; in any event Pitane could not afford to make the transaction alone.

In this period continuous and permanent Attalid hegemony over Mysian territory was apparently limited to Pergamon and its surroundings.<ref target="fnd0e4306" type="fnoteref">56</ref> Pergamon was, of course, the most important city of Mysia. I include it among the list of Hellenistic settlements because Philetairos, the founder of the Attalid dynasty, undertook major urban development programs in the city and, as a result, was honored as a "founder" by the Pergamenes. There were also Macedonians settled in the city (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 338.14) and a military colony, name unknown, nearby.<ref target="fnd0e4331" type="fnoteref">57</ref> Another Attalid foundation in Mysia was PHILETAIREIA by Ida. M. I. Rostovtzeff has emphasized the importance of the area around Mount Ida, noting that its forests were the primary source of timber for the Attalid navy (Strabo 13.1.51), it was an important horse-breeding region (Plut. <hi rend="italic">Eum</hi> . 8.3), and it contained the only major copper and silver mines in the area (Strabo 13.1.51, 56).<ref target="fnd0e4338" type="fnoteref">58</ref> To the east, the valley of the Kaikos River had to be protected from the Bithynians and Galatians.

                  <p>In Mysia, too, we encounter an APOLLONIA (Strabo 13-4.4).

                     <hi rend="italic">Ionia</hi> . Ionia is, of course, a region whose Greek cities long predated the advent of the Hellenistic monarchs.

                  <p>Lysimachos was also active in Ionia. He refounded Smyrna as EURYDIKEIA and Ephesos as ARSINOE. Ancient Smyrna had apparently remained in an abject state since its destruction by Alyattes in the latter part of the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Strabo's description (14.1.37) indicates that the new city was a synoecism: first Antigonos Monophthalmos and then Lysimachos reassembled the village communities to form the new city. It is interesting to note, incidentally, that in addition to Smyrna Lysimachos refounded at least two other settlements of Monophthalmos: ANTIGONEIA Troas as ALEXANDREIA and ANTIGONEIA in Bithynia as NIKAIA. Lysimachos' refounding of Ephesos was also a major project. It involved moving the Ephesian population to a new site closer to the sea, bringing in additional people from Kolophon and Lebedos, and building a wall for the new city. The new city was important enough for Queen Arsinoe to use as her residence in 281. Furthermore there was a royal mint there.</p>
                  <p>After the battle of Korupedion in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Ionia came under Seleucid rule.

                  <p>Magnesia, Priene, Miletos, and possibly Teos.<ref target="fnd0e4531" type="fnoteref">65</ref> Despite the extensive evidence for a Seleucid and a Ptolemaic presence in Ionia the only settlement there that we can ascribe to either royal house is PTOLEMAIS, the refounded Lebedos, possibly the work of Ptolemy III. There is no other extant evidence to indicate either dynasty founded additional colonies or refounded cities in the region. This gap is striking. In the first place it contrasts sharply with the information we have for the earlier activity of Antigonos and Lysimachos in the same region. And, second, it also contrasts with the plentiful evidence for Hellenistic—and, in particular, Macedonian—colonization in neighboring Lydia and Caria. The reason for the apparent lack of colonizing in Ionia is unclear. A. H. M. Jones suggested that "the Seleucids were more interested in the interior."<ref target="fnd0e4537" type="fnoteref">66</ref> Alternatively we may note the continuing struggle between the Ptolemies and the Seleucids in the region. This, however, would hardly have prevented colonization; a similar state of affairs on the south coast of Asia Minor had no such effect. Finally, we should recall that in population and history Ionia had more in common with the Greek mainland than with the rest of Asia Minor. I have already noted the absence of evidence for military colonies in Greece and the fact that in Greece south of Thessaly we know of only one Antigonid settlement—DEMETRIAS Sikyon. This was founded by Demetrios Poliorketes at the end of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> There is no evidence for any subsequent Antigonid colonizing in the region. Apparently the Antigonids preferred to maintain their control by means of garrisons rather than colonies. We may wonder, therefore, whether Ionian Greek sensitivity about Macedonian colonization prompted the Seleucids to use garrisons—as they did, for example, at Ephesos (Ath. 593b-d)—rather than settlements to control the region.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Lydia and Phrygia</hi> . Both Lydia and Phrygia were areas of heavy colonization in the Hellenistic period. Many of the settlements were founded on or near the trade routes that connected the Aegean littoral with the East, both to protect these routes and to take advantage of the commercial opportunities they offered. Although not intensively Hellenized at the time of Alexander's arrival, Lydia and Phrygia were far more civilized than, for example, Galatia and Cappadocia. The Lydian kingdom under the Mermnad dynasty (c. 700 - 550 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ) was the dominant power in western Asia Minor until it was conquered by the Persians.

                  <p>The evidence for Antigonos Monophthalmos' settlements in Asia Minor is limited to the west and northwest coastal region. We have no definite information about any active colonizing by him in the interior, that is, in Lydia and Phrygia. In Phrygia DOKIMEION was probably founded by Dokimos, Antigonos' general. But did he found Dokimeion as Antigonos' general or as an independent dynast? The same question may also be asked about SYNNADA. Whatever Dokimos' status we should note in passing that he was active around the end of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> This would place Dokimeion and Synnada among the earliest Hellenistic settlements in Asia Minor. As for Kelainai, we know that it was the capital of the Persian satrapy of Phrygia (Xen. <hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 1.2.7-9; Art. <hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 1.29.1), that Antigonos was frequently to be found there (Diod. 18.52.1; 19.69.2 and 93.4; Plut. <hi rend="italic"> Demetr</hi> . 6.3), and that Eumenes wintered there in 321 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Plut. <hi rend="italic">Eum</hi> . 8.4).<ref target="fnd0e4590" type="fnoteref">68</ref> What we do not know is whether Antigonos actually refounded the city (as Antiochos I later did) or whether he brought colonists to it. Finally, KRETOPOLIS in Pisidia: it is possible that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a Hellenistic foundation. Unfortunately the circumstances of its founding—assuming it was a Hellenistic colony—are completely unknown. Discussion about Antigonos' possible role in founding it is speculative and should not be pressed.</p>
                  <p>In discussing Antigonos Monophthalmos' achievements Billows has argued convincingly that his role as a colonizer has tended to be overshadowed by the Seleucid program.<ref target="fnd0e4603" type="fnoteref">69</ref> He points out that we know of three cases—ANTIGONEIA Troas, in Bithynia, and on the Orontes—where Antigonos' settlement was later refounded. He suggests—quite reasonably—that colonies of Antigonos may have been behind many of the Seleucid settlements. There is merit in Billows's objection in favor of Antigonos as a major colonizer. We should, after all, expect that he would have built colonies in Asia Minor as well as in Asia. The difficulty is, as he points out, the lack of evidence. In Asia Minor we know Antigonos was especially active on the west coast. Thus we find ANTIGONEIA Troas, the reestablishment of Smyrna as EURYDIKEIA, the enlargement of KOLOPHON, and Antigonos' plans for the synoecism of Teos and Lebedos. Turning to the interior regions of Asia Minor, where incidentally his rule</p>

                  <p>was remembered with great nostalgia (Plut. <hi rend="italic">Phocion</hi> 29.1), we are faced with a lack of unequivocal evidence for any kind of colony founding activity by him. This contrasts sharply with the extensive evidence for Seleucid activity in the region (see below). How many of these Seleucid settlements originated as foundations of Antigonos (or of Lysimachos) is unknown. There is also evidence for colonies of Macedonians in Lydia and Phrygia. In practically all these cases, as, for example, at NAKRASON, the founder is not known. In any event it is unlikely that Monophthalmos, who never ruled Macedonia and who was hostile to Kassandros, would have been able to recruit actively there. He could, of course, recruit Greek soldiers from Asia Minor and the regions in Greece under his control. But the only Macedonians he could recruit were those already in Asia Minor and Asia. On the other hand, Antiochos I and II, by virtue of their friendliness with Antigonos Gonatas, would have had far easier access to Macedonia. In short the available evidence makes clear that the Seleucids were very active founding settlements in the interior of Asia Minor. It says nothing about a similar Antigonid effort.</p>
                  <p>There were, of course, other means available to control an area. According to Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">Eum</hi> . 3-7), when Eumenes was appointed satrap over Cappadocia he distributed cities to his friends, left behind judges (<hi rend="italic">dikastai</hi> ) and administrators (<hi rend="italic">dioiketai</hi> ), and appointed garrison commanders. Undoubtedly Antigonos followed a similar path in ruling Asia Manor. I have referred elsewhere to the evidence for the presence of Antigonid garrisons on the south coast of Asia Minor. We might note in passing that there is also evidence for garrisons throughout Phoenicia (Diod. 19.59.2, 61.5, 86.1), at Ephesos (20.111.3) and Korinth (20.103.3), and at other cities and fortresses (19.85.5), and, finally, that Stephanos (s.v. "Antigoneia") refers to the Kyzikene ANTIGONEIA as a "fortress." And Ptolemy was quite willing to accuse Antigonos of having occupied some Greek cities with garrisons (Diod. 20.19.3). In the interior of Asia Minor the epigraphic evidence for garrisons is very slight: one attestation in Caria and one on the Pisidian/Lycian frontier.<ref target="fnd0e4636" type="fnoteref">70</ref> We may well expect that there were other Antigonid garrisons elsewhere in the interior. Aside from garrisons the Antigonids conld also maintain a presence by granting land to individuals. Thus the well-known Mnesimachos inscription records the granting of a large estate in the plain of Sardis by Antigonos (presumably this is the king) to Mnesimachos.<ref target="fnd0e4649" type="fnoteref">71</ref> It also mentions <hi rend="italic">kleroi</hi> , or land lots, on it, and</p>

The granting of land for settlement to individual soldiers is found elsewhere in Asia Minor. For example, Eupolemos may have given land to individual colonists who then settled around PENTACIHORA in Caria.</p>
                  <p>Following Antigonos' defeat at Ipsos in 301 Lysimachos gained control of central and western Asia Minor. Then in 296/5 he was able to seize the west coast of Asia Minor from Demetrios Poliorketes. The extant evidence for Lysimachos' colonizing activity in Asia Minor is strikingly similar to what I have already noted for Antigonos: while we know of Lysimachos' colonizing activity along the coast—for example, ALEXANDREIA Troas, ILION, ARSINOE Ephesos, EURYDIKEIA Smyrna—we have no evidence that he built any foundations in Lydia or Phrygia.</p>
                  <p>A problem for the Seleucids was how to maintain access to their western possessions. The sea was not a real possibility. The Seleucid navy was weak and no match for the Ptolemaic fleet. Furthermore, the Ptolemies controlled much of the Aegean until the middle of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Finally, as I have noted, the west coast ports were not always in Seleucid hands. The only means of keeping contact with western Asia Minor, therefore, was by land.</p>
                  <p>In antiquity there were a number of major highways linking the Aegean coast of Asia Minor with the East. The first, the famous "Royal Road" of the Persian Empire, began in the Hermos River valley. Another, farther south, ran through the Maeander River valley. This is the road Strabo, citing Artemidorus (fl. 104 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), refers to as the "Common Road" used by all who traveled from Ephesos to the East (14.2.29). It was the main trade route across Asia Minor in the Hellenistic period. Strabo says the road passed through Magnesia on the Maeander, (SELEUKEIA) Tralleis, NYSA, ANTIOCH on the Maeander, LAODIKEIA on the Lykos, APAMEIA Kelainai, METROPOLIS, Holmoi, PHILOMELION, LAODIKEIA Katakekaumene, Mazaka (EUSEBEIA near Argaios) in Cappadocia, and on toward Mesopotamia. The southern trunk line of the road branched off beyond Laodikeia to Ikonion and Kybistra and then passed through the Cilician Gates into Cilicia. This is also the road, incidentally, that Cicero took in 51 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> when he traveled from Ephesos to Tarsos. Cicero provides an itinerary of the trip in the course of some of his letters to Atticus. He departed from Ephesos in late July and stopped at, among other places, Tralleis, Laodikeia, Apameia, Synnada, Philomelion, Ikonion,</p>

It also explains Seleukos I Nikator's concern for building a stable presence in Cilicia: the Cilician Gates provided the major access to the Common Road.</p>
                  <p>By 274 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> there definitely was a colony at THYATEIRA. A dedication dated to the thirty-seventh year of the Seleucid era has been found there. Furthermore another inscription records a dedication by the Macedonian officers and soldiers to King Seleukos (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 211), who was undoubtedly the founder, as Stephanos says (s.v. "Thyateira"). However, other inscriptions from Thyateira, which, incidentally, also record the presence of Macedonians, have been dated palaeographically to the end of the fourth century. If this dating is correct, we might have evidence for colonists in Lydia that could be connected with Antigonos, or, drawing it down a bit, with Lysimachos. But this line of investigation is hypothetical and, in any event, provides our only possible indication of pre-Seleucid colonizing activity in Lydia. Furthermore at HYRKANIS there was a Macedonian colony where the descendants of the colonists worshipped Zeus Seleukeios. There is, in fact, a great deal of evidence attesting the existence of colonies of Macedonians in Lydia. In addition to the two colonies I have already noted I would mention AGATHEIRA, APOLLONIS, DOIDYE, -ESPOURA, KOBEDYLE, and PHILADELPHEIA as well as AKRASOS, MAKEDONES, MYSOMAKEDONES, and NAKRASON. None of these are attested in the period of Seleucid rule. The first six are known in the Attalid period, the last four under Roman rule. For two, Apollonis and Philadelpheia, we have specific testimony that they were founded by the Attalids. For the others there is no indication of the founder. However, it is a reasonable working hypothesis that they were originally established by the Seleucids or their predecessors rather than the Pergamenes.<ref target="fnd0e4740" type="fnoteref">74</ref> It is interesting that the two settlements whose founders we know were cities. The others were smaller colonies. Presumably, like Thyateira, many were originally organized on military lines. Later on, some of them, like KOBEDYLE, apparently became part of existing cities.</p>

                  <p>The smaller, mainly rural colonies are attested primarily in western Asia Minor: in Lydia and, to a lesser degree, in the neighboring regions. In contrast, settlements with dynastic names are surprisingly rare in Lydia. I count only three: the two Attalid cities mentioned earlier and STRATONIKEIA. The latter is the only settlement in Lydia with a dynastic name that may possibly be ascribed to the Seleucids. If, as is reasonable to assume, a dynastic name is one of the indications of polis status for a colony, then we are faced with the possibility that the Seleucids founded, at the most, only one settlement in Lydia that became a city. This contrasts sharply with their activity in the neighboring areas of Caria and Phrygia. In the former we encounter two ANTIOCHS (Alabanda and on the Maeander), NYSA, SELEUKEIA Tralleis, STRATONIKEIA, and APOLLONIA Salbake. In the latter we find ANTIOCH near Pisidia, APAMEIA Kelainai, and LAODIKEIA on the Lykos. Farther away, in Pisidia, Pamphylia, and Cilicia we also find settlements with dynastic names.</p>
                  <p>The direct evidence for Seleucid settlements in Lydia is rather sparse. PALAIMAGNESIA and the JEWISH COLONIES dispatched by Antiochos III are the only colonies in Lydia we can unequivocally ascribe to the Seleucids. There is a strong probability that THYATEIRA, HYRKANIS, and MAGNESIA near Sipylos were Seleucid; in addition, STRATONIKEIA was possibly also founded by the Seleucids. Finally, we should recall that after destroying part of SARDIS for its support of Achaios, Antiochos III rebuilt it. Sardis is, incidentally, the only Lydian city that had a Seleucid mint.<ref target="fnd0e4758" type="fnoteref">75</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Attalids we may note, in addition to the colonies mentioned above, the PANTHEOTAI and LASNEDDA, as well as ATTALEIA and MERNOUPHYTA. The latter two are, along with PHILADELPHEIA and APOLLONIS, the only settlements in Lydia that can be definitely attributed to them. The difficulty for us is determining how many of the settlements first attested under the Attalids were founded by them, rather than inherited from the Seleucids or their predecessors in the area. As I have mentioned, probability favors their having been inherited. But this is only probability.</p>
                  <p>In Phrygia we know of at least four Seleucid foundations: LAODIKEIA on the Lykos, HIERAPOLIS, APAMEIA Kelainai, and ANTIOCH near Pisidia. The importance of Apameia—and, hence, of Phrygia—to the Seleucids is clear from the fact that they maintained a palace there. In addition there were numerous settlements that have yielded evidence for the presence of Macedonians: for example, BLAUNDOS, DOKIMEION, DORYLAION, HIERAPOLIS,</p>

                  <p>LAODIKEIA on the Lykos, METROPOLIS, and PELTAI. The problem is that all the attestations date from the Imperial period, long after the age of Hellenistic colonization. In fact there is no extant Hellenistic evidence for Macedonians in Phrygia.<ref target="fnd0e4796" type="fnoteref">76</ref> Undoubtedly some of these Macedonians were descended from Seleucid colonists. Unfortunately, however, there is no evidence available to confirm this.</p>
                  <p>It is interesting—and potentially useful—to plot the locations of the settlements on a map. I have already noted the numerous colonies founded along the great trade route that ran from Ephesos to Cilicia and Mesopotamia. In Lydia there were a number of north-south roads.<ref target="fnd0e4803" type="fnoteref">77</ref> The importance of one such road is clearly seen from the major settlements along its path: the road, which began in the Hellespont at Kyzikos, ran past STRATONIKEIA, close to ATTALEIA, then to THYATEIRA, SARDIS, PHILADEL-PHEIA, and HIERAPOLIS before joining the Common Road at LAODIKEIA on the Lykos.</p>
                  <p>The proximity of many colonies to each other has prompted some scholars to suggest that certain Attalid settlements were built with an eye to particular Seleucid colonies. For example, W. M. Ramsay long ago suggested that the Pergamene settlements were often sited over against Seleucid foundations; thus he claimed that APOLLONIA in Mysia "answered to" NAKRASA (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi> ), ATTALEIA to THYATEIRA, DIONYSOPOLIS to BLAUNDOS, EUMENEIA to PELTAI, APOLLONIA in Phrygia to SELEUKEIA in Pisidia, and that APOLLONIS was on the site of DOIDYE.<ref target="fnd0e4810" type="fnoteref">78</ref> This reconstruction is rather neat. Unfortunately it does not always stand up under scrutiny. Thus Apollonia in Mysia was probably not a Hellenistic colony. There are also serious questions regarding the founders of Nakrason and Akrasos, Blaundos, Peltai, and Apollonia in Phrygia. Furthermore, after 188 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> the Attalid empire encompassed most of western Asia Minor. As a result, the settlements built by Eumenes II and Attalos II did not have to answer the same strategic concerns as many of the earlier Seleucid colonies. In addition, Louis Robert has demonstrated that whereas the Seleucid colonies were founded for strategic reasons, the Pergamene settlements, such as ATTALEIA, were in areas of great fertility but of little strategic value.<ref target="fnd0e4817" type="fnoteref">79</ref> According to Robert, they were not fortresses guarding a particular region or road. Rather they were rural centers founded simply in order to give fertile land to settlers (Polyb. 5.78.5).</p>

                  <p>Despite this criticism of Ramsay one must grant that, in theory, he was not completely wrong. Nor is there an inherent contradiction with Robert. Undoubtedly some of the Attalid colonies were built with an eye to a Seleucid counterpart, past or present, and vice versa. Unfortunately in many cases, especially in connection with the colonies of Macedonians, we cannot identify the founder or the founding dynasty. Nevertheless we must bear in mind that the very factor(s) that induced one monarch to establish a colony in a particular area could induce another to do the same. Attaleia and Apollonis may not have been in the most strategically advantageous places, but they were located in the same region as Thyateira, Nakrason, and Akrasos. Surely the Attalids were aware of this when they chose the sites. After all, they had inherited a land empire dotted with colonists who had been loyal to the Seleucid royal house. With all of Lydia and Phrygia under Attalid control it was not necessary to seize the most strategic places. On the other hand, it was necessary to establish an Attalid presence in various regions that had only recently passed from Seleucid to Pergamene rule. This probably explains, for example, the decision to found PHILADELPHEIA and EUMENEIA. In short, many of the Attalid settlements <hi rend="italic">were</hi> founded to give good land to settlers. At the same time the choice of location suggests that the Attalids were also aware of the need to maintain a presence in certain areas and near certain former Seleucid colonies. Finally, there were other cases where the same foundation was built by one dynast and later refounded by another. I have already mentioned the case of ANTIGONEIA/ALEXANDREIA Troas and ANTIGONEIA/NIKAIA in Bithynia. This was also apparently the case with HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia, which benefited from both Seleucid and Pergamene attention. Hierapolis was, of course, a major religious center. It made sense, therefore, that the Attalids would want to lavish as much attention on it as their predecessors.</p>
                  <p>I have mentioned elsewhere the presence of colonies in Phrygia that were probably founded by independent dynasts. In this connection we might also note the evidence for Pergamene activity in Phrygia. The Attalids did not come into permanent possession of Phrygia until after the Peace of Apameia in 188 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> It will not be surprising, therefore, that we know of only two Pergamene settlements there: FUMENEIA and DIONYSOPOLIS.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">The Southern Coast of Asia Minor</hi> . Earlier I mentioned the contrasting situation in the interior of Asia Minor as regards the absence of evidence for Antigonid colonies and the wealth of evidence for Seleucid settlements. A similar state of affairs is to be found on the southern coast. In the third century the Ptolemies and the Seleucids were both very active founding colonies along</p>
                  <pb id="JD_Page_50" n="50"/>
                  <p>the south coast of Asia Minor. Colonies of the former are to be found on the coast of Rough (i.e., western) Cilicia, Pamphylia, Lycia, and probably Caria as well. On the other hand, evidence for Seleucid colonies is primarily limited to Smooth (i.e., eastern) Cilicia and the eastern part of Rough Cilicia, as well as Pamphylia. In contrast there is no evidence that Antigonos Monophthalmos established colonies on the south coast of Asia Minor.</p>
                  <p>As a result of his shipbuilding program in 314 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Diod. 19.58.1-4) Antigonos was a major naval power in the eastern Mediterranean. In order to maintain his rule over the southern coast and to service his ships he apparently relied on various coastal towns where there were garrisons or shipyards. For example, Diodorus tells us that Antigonos established shipyards at Tripolis, Byblos, and Sidon in Phoenicia in order to take advantage of the forests of Lebanon, and in Cilicia, and that he also made use of one on the island of Rhodes. Regarding the Cilician and Rhodian shipyards, Diodorus says that timber from the Tauros Mountains was used for the former and was imported for the latter (19.58.4-5). In addition we know that Theodotos, Antigonos' admiral, sailed with his fleet from Patara in Lycia in 315 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Diod. 19.64.5) and that Demetrios Poliorketes put in at a Cilician harbor in 307 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> before crossing over to Cyprus (Diod. 20.47.1; cf. 20.93.4). As for garrisons, it is interesting to note that despite his repeated declarations supporting the freedom and autonomy of the Greeks Antigonos apparently maintained garrisons in a number of Cilician cities (20.19.3-5). We also know of garrisons in Kaunos in Carla and Xanthos in Lycia (Diod. 20.27. 1-2). Presumably others existed as well. On the other hand, there is no evidence for colonizing by Antigonos along the south coast. This contrasts sharply with the situation under the Ptolemies.</p>
                  <p>In the period before the battle of Ipsos in 301 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Antigonos and Demetrios contended vigorously with Ptolemy I for control of the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean basin. In the continuing and often confused struggle Ptolemy gained and lost numerous territories. Thus he conquered Syria and Phoenicia in 320 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> only to lose it in 315 to Antigonos.<ref target="fnd0e4876" type="fnoteref">80</ref> After his defeat of Demetrios Poliorketes in 312 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> at Gaza Ptolemy was able, temporarily, to retake Palestine; shortly afterward, however, he yielded it once again to Demetrios and Antigonos (Diod. 19.93-94; Plut. <hi rend="italic">Demetr</hi> . 6.3). In 310 he took control</p>

In 309 he captured various cities on the Lycian and Carian coast and the island Kos (Diod. 20.27.1-2). In the same year he took some Cilician cities but soon lost them (Diod. 20.19.4 and 27.1). In 308 he sent a large expedition to the Peloponnese, but, having failed to rally the Greeks to his side, he departed, leaving garrisons in Sikyon and Korinth (Diod. 20.37.2).<ref target="fnd0e4928" type="fnoteref">81</ref>

                  <p>Ipsos radically changed the situation. Antigonos' land empire was divided among the victors. And even though Demetrios still controlled the League of the Islanders and Cyprus as well as various coastal towns in Greece, Asia Minor, and Phoenicia, his star was waning. Ptolemy was quite ready to chip away at the few remaining possessions of Demetrios' sundering empire. Though Ptolemy did not fight at Ipsos, he seized control of southern Syria as his share of the spoils (Diod. 21.1.5). This was to remain under Egyptian hegemony until 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Then in 294 he retook Cyprus, and after 287 he seized the League of the Islanders.<ref target="fnd0e4935" type="fnoteref">82</ref> Egypt now had significant territory in the Aegean and was a major presence in the eastern Mediterranean. And like the nineteenth-century British Empire, which focused; much of its effort on assuring a safe passage to India, so the Ptolemies needed to ensure that they had a safe and reliable passage to the Aegean and to Greece. For this they needed a strong navy and ports of call to service the fleet. This was the basis of the Ptolemaic policy to found colonies throughout the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean—in Cyprus, Crete, Keos, the Argolid, and along the southern coast of Asia Minor. For just as, according to Libanius (<hi rend="italic">Or</hi> . 11.100), Seleucid colonies served the needs of travelers along the main trade routes, so these Ptolemaic colonies served the needs of the Egyptian fleet.</p>
                  <p>The Ptolemies' need to colonize and control as much of the coast of Asia Minor as possible inevitably brought them into conflict with the Seleucids. In discussing the history of the conflicts between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies historians tend to concentrate their attention on the fight for control of Syria, the so-called Syrian Wars that were fought intermittently throughout the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> To some degree this has diverted modern attention from another contest that was going on at the same time: the struggle over the control of the western and southern coast of Asia Minor. Our evidence for this is particularly scrappy; but what is clear is that the two royal houses were as tenacious in their desire to rule these regions as they were to dominate Coele-Syria. And one way of maintaining control was to establish colonies in the area. Control of Cilicia and Pamphylia alternated between the Seleucids and Ptolemies throughout</p>

                  <p>much of the third century. However, because of the poor evidence it is not always possible to specify the precise holdings of either dynasty at a given time. According to Theocritus (17.88-89) Ptolemy II Philadelphos' overseas possessions included Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia, and Cilicia. According to the Adoulis inscription (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 54) Ptolemy III Euergetes I inherited, among other regions, Caria and Lycia from his father but conquered Pamphylia and Cilicia in his own right. Euergetes' claim to have conquered Cilicia is also mentioned by Hieronymus (<hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 260 F43). There is no necessary contradiction between the various sources. It is possible, after all, that Philadelphos lost some overseas territory that Euergetes subsequently reconquered. In any event, Ptolemaic control over much of the southern coast effectively came to an end in 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> when, according to Hieronymus, Antiochos III captured the following places from Ptolemy V: Selinos, Anemourion, Zephyrion, Aphrodisias, Korykos, Soloi, and Mallos in Cilicia as well as Xanthos, Patara, Andriake, and Limyra in Lycia.<ref target="fnd0e4978" type="fnoteref">83</ref>

                     <hi rend="italic">Caria</hi> . Antigonos Monophthalmos first came into possession of Caria in 312, when he overcame the Macedonian satrap, Asandros. Although it remained under his rule until the battle of Ipsos, various coastal sites did, at one time or another in the last decade of the fourth century, fall to Ptolemaic attacks or ally themselves with the Egyptians. For example, Kaunos was occupied by Ptolemaic troops in 309 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> (Diod. 20.27.2). Around the same time IASOS was allied with Ptolemy, and in 308 Myndos served as a port of embarkation for the Egyptian fleet on its way to the Peloponnese.<ref target="fnd0e4991" type="fnoteref">84</ref> After Ipsos, Pleistarchos, the brother of Kassandros, came into possession of Caria. In the short time that he controlled the area, namely, from 301 until 295 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , he built at least one settlement, the eponymous PLEISTARCHEIA. We do not know the precise limits of Pleistarchos' princedom. Apparently it was confined to central Caria, encompassing the area of Mylasa to Hyllarima. Billows has argued convincingly that around 295/4 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Pleistarchos' territory came under attack from the north by Lysimachos and from the south by Ptolemy I.<ref target="fnd0e5021" type="fnoteref">85</ref> He has</p>

                  <p>There were a number of Seleucid settlements in northern and central Caria: ANTIOCH on the Maeander, NYSA, SELEUKEIA Tralleis, ANTIOCH Alabanda, APOLLONIA Salbake, and STRATONIKEIA. The factors underlying the decision to found these settlements are not far to seek. I have already noted that the first three were located in the Maeander River valley on the Common Road. Furthermore Apollonia Salbake, Nysa, Seleukeia Tralleis, and Stratonikeia were located at the site of or close to important religious centers. Finally, there was the Ptolemaic threat. On most of the southern littoral of Asia Minor the Ptolemies apparently confined themselves to the coastal regions. Caria is one of the few regions in southern Asia Minor, along with Lycia, where we have evidence for the Ptolemies penetrating significantly into the interior.<ref target="fnd0e5065" type="fnoteref">86</ref> For example, a Ptolemaic inscription (<hi rend="italic">I. Strat</hi> . 1002) from the area of STRATONIKEIA is dated to the year 274 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (six years later it was under Seleucid domination: probably an accurate reflection of the tension between the two dynasties in Caria and their constant jockeying for control). And a decree of the Chrysaoric League (<hi rend="italic">I. Labraunda</hi> 43), dated to the nineteenth year of King Ptolemy (i.e., 267 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), indicates that at the time Labraunda and MYLASA were under Ptolemaic rule. There is also evidence for AMYZON under Ptolemaic rule: a decree from AMYZON is dated to the ninth year of Ptolemy Philadelphos.<ref target="fnd0e5074" type="fnoteref">87</ref> Later, at the very end of the third century, Antiochos III took control of Amyzon. The transition can be seen in a letter of Antiochos to Amyzon, written in 203 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , which promises to maintain the privileges that had previously been granted when the city was in the Ptolemaic alliance.<ref target="fnd0e5084" type="fnoteref">88</ref> The changeover apparently resulted in some dislocation. In 201 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> the Seleucid epistates, Menestratos, arranged for the repopulation of the Artemision at Amyzon. Despite the extensive evidence for a Ptolemaic presence in the interior of Caria, only one Egyptian colony is attested, PTOLEMAIS. Like many other Ptolemaic colonies, it was probably located on the coast. Finally, a recently published inscription suggests that Euromos may</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Pamphylia</hi> . The situation of Pamphylia in the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> is particularly difficult to clarify. Theocritus (17.88) lists Parnphylia among the possessions of Ptolemy II Philadelphos. Furthermore Philadelphos appointed a Pamphyli[arch] over the area in 278 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
                     <ref target="fnd0e5232" type="fnoteref">92</ref> However, since Ptolemy III claimed Pamphylia as one of his conquests (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 54.14), it is probable that (part or all of) the territory had been lost and recaptured. Later, in 218, the usurper Achaios overran most of Pamphylia (Polyb. 5.77.1), effectively ending Ptolemaic rule in the region. In 213 Achaios was captured and executed by Antiochos III. Presumably at that time Achaios' holdings were turned over to Antiochos.

                  <p>Hieronymus' silence reflects the fact that the Pamphylian cities had already transferred and maintained their allegiance to Antiochos. It should be emphasized, however, that our evidence is so scrappy that it is not possible to indicate precisely the duration or the extent of Ptolemaic or Seleucid rule in Pamphylia. There was an ARSINOE (as well as a PTOLEMAIS) in Pamphylia, and, according to Strabo (14.5.3), it was located near an area that supplied shipbuilding timber used by Cleopatra VII. Undoubtedly her predecessors also exploited this resource and founded Arsinoe in that connection. There were, in addition to the Ptolemaic foundations in Pamphylia, a SELEUKEIA and an ATTALEIA (the modern Antalya). The location of the latter should be noted. As a result of the Peace of Apameia in 188 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> the Attalids had come into possession of a large part of Asia Minor. However, as M. Holleaux has pointed out, the liberated Greek cities on the western coast of Asia Minor limited Eumenes II's access to the Aegean.<ref target="fnd0e5269" type="fnoteref">93</ref> AS a result the king was particularly concerned about having outlets on the south coast. Attaleia provided that outlet. Its precise founding date is, however, unknown.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Cilicia</hi> . I have already mentioned that in 314 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Antigonos Monophthalmos undertook a major shipbuilding program. As part of this effort he established a number of shipyards throughout the eastern Mediterranean (Diod. 19.58.1-4). He founded one in Cilicia because of the timber from the nearby Tauros Mountains. Furthermore, before Demetrios Poliorketes set out on his expedition to Cyprus in 307 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> he put in at Cilicia in order to assemble additional soldiers and ships (Diod. 20.47.1). We do not know, however, where his fleet anchored or where his father built his ships.</p>
                  <p>For the Seleucids possession of Cilicia was extremely important, because it controlled access to the land route from Syria to central and western Asia Minor. Seleucid concern over this region can clearly be seen in their colonizing activity both in the early third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and again in the first part of the second century. In the first part of the third century Seleukos I Nikator founded SELEUKEIA on the Kalykadnos. As the existence of ANTIOCH on the Kydnos is first attested in the mid-third century the possibility arises that it, too, was founded by Nikator. It is also possible that ANTIOCH on the Pyramos was established in the third century. One is led to wonder, therefore, if Seleukos was trying to establish a Seleucid presence in Cilicia with these (and other?) settlements in much the same way as he was anchoring a Seleucid presence in</p>

                  <p>Later, in the second century, Antiochos IV Epiphanes turned his attention to the area. While no settlement in the area can definitely be attributed to him it is possible that he founded or refounded ANTIOCH on the Saros, EPIPHANEIA Oiniandos, HIERAPOLIS Castabala, and SELEUKEIA on the Pyramos. These (re)foundations were probably little more than formal renamings. Despite that it is interesting to find Epiphanes attempting to emulate his ancestors. It certainly would have made sense for Antiochos to try to reinvigorate a Seleucid presence in the area. By the time he came to the throne the Seleucid empire had shrunk to a fraction of its original size. Hence it is quite understandable that Antiochos would want to reassert a Seleucid presence in part of the territory still subject to his rule.</p>
                  <p>In the Greek mind Cilicia was geographically on the eastern extremity of Asia Minor. When Isocrates recommended to Philip that he colonize Asia Minor he described the area as "Asia from Cilicia to Sinope—as some say" (<hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> 120).<ref target="fnd0e5303" type="fnoteref">94</ref> For the overland traveler moving eastward the passage through the Clilician Gates opened the way to Syria and regions farther east. In fact it is in Cilicia that we have our first evidence for a settlement named for a Macedonian or Greek town. AIOEAI on the Cilician coast was undoubtedly given the name of the old Macedonian capital. This practice, of course, becomes prevalent in Syria and throughout Asia. Nevertheless it is noteworthy that no examples of this kind of toponym are attested in Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains.</p>
                  <p>For the Ptolemies Cilicia had definite attractions. From the strategic point of view control of the region meant the ability to cut off the Seleucids from a vital east-west route. Equally important was the shipbuilding timber that Cilicia, along with Pamphylia, supplied. Ready access to shipbuilding material was obviously of the highest importance to the Ptolemies, who were trying to control an overseas empire with a large navy and yet ruled a state that was virtually devoid of timber. In addition to material, Cilicia was also a source of manpower. One sees frequent references, for example, to Cilicians in Ptolemaic garrisons in Clyprus.<ref target="fnd0e5310" type="fnoteref">95</ref>

                  <p>In this region we can identify two Seleucid colonies, LAODIKEIA Katakekaumene and SELEUKEIA, and possibly a third, NEAPOLIS. J. D. Grainger, noting that LAODIKEIA and SELEUKEIA, along with APAMEIA Kelainai, APOLLONIA, and ANTIOCH, were located on the northern fringe of Pisidia, has suggested these settlements were founded in order to "enclose the Pisidians in a crescent of forts."<ref target="fnd0e5384" type="fnoteref">97</ref> He is undoubtedly correct.

Both were probably founded by the philhellene Ariarathes V Eusebes and have left evidence of developed civic institutions. Furthermore we should recall that Ariarathes V maintained a correspondence with the philosopher Carneades. Nevertheless most of Cappadocia remained relatively immune to urbanization and Hellenization. Strabo, for example, remarked that in his day the native language was still widely spoken (12.1.2).<ref target="fnd0e5451" type="fnoteref">100</ref>

                     <hi rend="italic">Northern Asia Minor</hi> . Because of distance, the barrier presented by the Pontic Alps, and, after 278 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , the presence of the Gauls, the Seleucids were never able to get control of northern Asia Minor. The geopolitical situation in Hellenistic Asia Minor will, I believe, become clearer if we also consider the east-west highway system. It will be recalled that in the Hellenistic era the major east-west road was no longer the Royal Road, which began in the Hermos River valley, but rather the Common Road, which originated farther south in the Maeander valley (Strabo 14.2.29). The primary focus of east-west land travel in Asia Minor was from Syria to the Aegean littoral and back. Under the Republic and early Empire the Common Road and its western terminus, Ephesos, remained a vital link for communication with Rome. One can see that dearly in Cicero's itinerary of 51 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Att</hi> . 5.13-20).</p>

The willingness of Alexander and the successor kings to allow the northern kingdoms to go their own way certainly reflects the immense difficulties involved in controlling them. However, it probably also reflects strategic priorities that differed quite significantly from those facing the Roman emperors. In short, during the Hellenistic period the Mediterranean and the Aegean were still the central focus of strategic planning by all the major dynasties. As a result, Bithynia and Pontus were on the periphery and thus not as important strategically as they would later become.</p>

                  <p>Pontus represents an interesting contrast with Bithynia. Despite the philhellenic tendencies of the royal house the country remained much less Hellenized and urbanized than Bithynia. The village, not the city, predominated, while temples exerted a major influence on the country. Whereas one can identify ten Hellenistic settlements in Bithynia, it is possible to recognize only four in Pontus; two were built by Mithridates VI Eupator. The earliest settlement was probably PHARNAKEIA toward the eastern extremity of the Pontic coast; presumably it was founded by Pharnakes I soon after he captured Sinope in 183 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Both EUPATORIA Amisos on the Black Sea and EUPATORIA Magnopolis in the interior were established by Mithridates VI. The founder of LAODIKEIA is not known. Finally, AMASTRIS, which was technically in Paphlagonia, was founded by Amastris, the wife of Dionysios of Herakleia and, later, of Lysimachos. After the battle of Korupedion it came into the possession of Mithridates III's son, Ariobarzanes.</p>
                  <p>The Mithridatids were also active elsewhere. On the northern and western Black Sea coast Pharnakes established ties with Chersonesos in the Crimea and Odessos in Bulgaria.

                  <p>The history of the Bithynian kingdom is one of expansion, eastward toward Herakleia and Paphlagonia, southward toward the Mysian Mount Olympos, and westward toward the Propontis.<ref target="fnd0e5626" type="fnoteref">107</ref> In the process of expanding, the Bithynians, particularly Nikomedes I and Prousias I, were active in founding settlements. Zipoites founded the eponymous ZIPOITION. His son and ultimate successor, Nikomedes I, founded NIKOMEDEIA on the Astakene Gulf. This foundation was particularly important because it gave the Bithynians access to the sea. Nikomedes was, of course, a great philhellene; the statue erected to him at Olympia attests his many benefactions (Paus. 5.12.7). Thus the founding of Nikomedeia was, like Peter the Great's founding of St. Petersburg, an act of major significance, commercially and culturally as well as politically. It is surely not coincidental that the Bithynian king cultivated good relations with Antigonos Gonatas and Ptolemy II Philadelphos, both of whom were among the executors of his will (Memnon, <hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 434: F14). Nikomedeia's potential as a commercial center would have been severely stunted if shipping lanes to and from it ran through hostile waters. In this connection Rostovtzeff has called attention to a very illuminating document, the letter of Ziaëlas to Cos recognizing the inviolability Grits temple of Asklepios and promising protection to merchants from Kos (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 25). I quote Rostovtzeff: "In this reply we read between the lines that he [i.e., Ziaëlas] perfectly understood the position of the Coans and the real aim of the embassy. He insists that he will follow the policy of his father and will remain faithful to his friendship and alliance with [Ptolemy III] Euergetes. His friendliness to the Coans was in fact an expression of his feelings towards Euergetes: 'and because King Ptolemy, our friend and ally, is well disposed towards you.' What the Coans, and behind them Ptolemy, really wanted to obtain from Ziaëlas was an assurance of his friendly and helpful attitude towards Greek merchants, who were ready to trade with him, provided they had this assurance. Ziaëlas replies quite explicitly. He assures the ambassadors that he takes good care 'of all Greeks who repair to us', and in express terms he guarantees complete safety to all sea-going folk who land in Bithynia or are wrecked on its coast.

                  <p>As part of his eastward expansion Ziaëlas apparently founded an eponymous city, though probably not as far east as Cappadocia, as Stephanos (s.v. "Zela") says. His son, Prousias I, was especially active as a founder of cities. As a result of military assistance given to Philip V of Macedon in 202 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Prousias came into possession of Kios and Myrleia in Hellespontine Phrygia. These cities, which represented a further westward expansion, were refounded as PROUSIAS by the Sea and APAMEIA, respectively. Both of these gave the Bithynians even greater access to Aegean markets; they also allowed the Bithynians, with an eye to Pergamon, to establish a secure presence in the southern part of their kingdom. Early in the second century Prousias turned eastward and captured Kieros from Herakleia on the Pontos. He then renamed it after himself. Around the same time the king founded PROUSA in the southern part of his territory at the foot of the Mysian Mount Olympos, presumably to fortify his southern border against the Attalids. Finally, I should mention NIKAIA. It was obviously an important city. Nevertheless it is well to recall that it was not founded by the Bithynian dynasty. It was rather a foundation of Antigonos and Lysimachos that was inherited by the Bithynians.</p>
                  <p>The experience of Bithynia in the Hellenistic period presents a good example of the function and the result of Hellenistic colonization. In the third and early second centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> the Bithynian kingdom was expanding. And like the other Hellenistic monarchs the Bithynians used urban foundations as a means of controlling newly won territory. Frequently, in good Macedonian fashion, they named their foundations for themselves. As elsewhere in the Hellenistic world, different settlements served different purposes. Thus Nikomedeia was established primarily for political and economic reasons, while Prousa was founded with an eye to military needs. Furthermore, like settlements elsewhere in the Hellenistic world, these foundations were built on Greek models and became centers of Greek culture. In this way the economic, political, and strategic needs of the Bithynian kings melded with their philhellenism. The Bithynian achievement, however, may also serve as a good example of the limits of Hellenization, to use Momigliano's expression. We know about the cities that were founded and the Hellenization this implied. What we do not know is the degree to which this Hellenization penetrated the countryside. Evidence is almost completely lacking. Undoubtedly, however, the Bithynian villages remained untouched by this program of urbanization. In this, too,</p>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">The Purpose of the Settlements</head>
               <p>What was the purpose of the various Hellenistic settlements in Europe and Asia Minor? We can distinguish military, economic, political, and administrative motives; of course in many cases these will have overlapped. Military considerations were dearly behind Philip's decision to send colonies to newly conquered parts of Thrace. According to Diodorus, "by founding strong cities at important places [Philip] stopped the rashness of the Thracians" (16.71.1-2). Polybius tells us that Alexander established a ring of Greek cities around Media in order to protect it from the neighboring barbarians (10.27). And Appian specifically says that Lysimachos founded Lysimacheia in Thrace as a bulwark against the Thracian menace (<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 1). Internal security was the primary concern of Antiochos III when he sent Jewish colonists to Lydia and Phrygia. In the letter sent to Zeuxis setting out his plan, Antiochos writes: "It is necessary to give my very serious consideration to a revolt which I learn has broken out among the inhabitants of Lydia and Phrygia; and having consulted with my friends as to what should be done, I have decided to convey two thousand Jewish families with their effects from Mesopotamia and Babylonia to the garrisons and most important places" (Joseph. <hi rend="italic"> AJ</hi> 12.149).</p>
               <p>The military significance of the settlements was twofold: <hi rend="italic"> (a)</hi> they served as sources for recruits, and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> they were frequently located at strategic sites. As for the recruitment of soldiers it will be recalled that, unlike Alexander, most of the Hellenistic monarchs could not bring over at will new recruits from Macedonia and Greece. By settling retired soldiers in colonies the kings were assuring a loyal presence at a particular place. And since the male children could be expected to do military service, they were also assuring the continued vitality of the army. G. T. Griffith and E Cumont have suggested that a military obligation was tied to the land lot settlers were given.<ref target="fnd0e5693" type="fnoteref">109</ref> This was the case, for example, in Ptolemaic Egypt. However, for the Seleucid empire there is no explicit evidence to support the suggestion. Other theories have proposed that service in the Seleucid army was tied to regional conscription or membership in a fraternal association.<ref target="fnd0e5703" type="fnoteref">110</ref> Whatever the nature of the military obligation,</p>

               <p>it is clear that the descendants of the original settlers served in the Seleucid, Ptolemaic, and other Hellenistic armies.</p>
               <p>In addition to founding colonies for military purposes the kings also re-founded older cities at more defensible sites or strengthened existing defences. Demetrios Poliorketes did this at Sikyon, which he renamed DEMETRIAS. It is also possible that his father played a role in the enlargement of the city walls of KOLOPHON.<ref target="fnd0e5736" type="fnoteref">111</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The importance of the location of a settlement is clearly seen in Diodorus' description of Antigoneia on the Orontes (20.47.5). He says the site was "naturally suited for keeping watch over Babylon and the upper satrapies and again for [keeping watch over] Lower Syria and... Egypt" (trans. R. Greer). Diodorus' comment is interesting. Antigoneia was in northern Syria. Nevertheless he evaluates its importance in terms of the control it exercised over areas that were considerably removed. Overland access to them, however, was controlled by the new settlement. This is what Diodorus meant when he said Antigoneia "kept watch" over these regions. The same will have been true for other colonies. I have already mentioned the strategic location of settlements like ANTIPATREIA in Illyria, ANTIGONEIA in Epirus, PHILIPPOPOLIS, the renamed Phthiotic Thebes, and DEMETRIAS in Thessaly. As Strabo noted (9.5.15), the latter was a naval station; in addition it controlled both the Vale of Tempe and the mountains Pelion and Ossa. ARSINOE Methana, described by Louis Robert as "une base idéale à l'entrée du golfe Saronique, un petit Gibraltar," was an important Ptolemaic naval base, as were many of the Ptolemaic settlements.<ref target="fnd0e5743" type="fnoteref">112</ref> ANTIOCH on the Maeander was on the Common Road that ran eastward from Ephesos to Phrygia and was the site of an important bridge that crossed the Maeander.</p>
               <p>The economic motive is implicit in Libanius' comment that Seleukos founded Antioch on the Orontes not just for enjoyment's sake but as a starting point in order that travelers could have cities instead of posthouses at which to stop (<hi rend="italic">Or</hi> . 11.100). We are dealing here with commercial travelers, not tourists, and the reference is clearly to cities built along the major trade routes. Strabo, for example, called APAMEIA Kelainai "the great emporium of Asia" (12.8.15), and already in the early fourth century Xenophon could describe Tarsos, the later ANTIOCH on the Kydnos, as "large and prosperous" (<hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 1.2.23).</p>

               <p>Tarsos was at the Cilician terminus of the southern trunk of the Common Road, while APAMEIA Kelainai occupied an important point on the central section of the highway. The western terminus of this road, Ephesos, was, according to Strabo (14.1.24), the most important emporium in Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains. The protection and enhancement of trade routes, whether on land or sea, was obviously a vital factor in the choice of sites that were to be colonized. The many settlements along or near such routes makes that quite clear. Of course the site of some colonies will have been chosen in order to take advantage of a natural resource in the vicinity. For example, the Ptolemaic settlements on the Cilician and Pamphylian coast were important both because they served as ports of call and because of their proximity to timber-producing regions. Similarly the native timber of Cyprus contributed to the importance of the various ARSINOES on the island. In Phrygia, both DOKIMEION and SYNNDA were located near great marble quarries. Economic considerations could also play a major role in the decision to relocate a city. Thus when silting of the Kayster River had cut off Ephesos from the sea Lysimachos moved the inhabitants to a new location—the refounded ARSINOE—where a harbor could be built.</p>
               <p>In the administrative and political sphere it is interesting to note that a number of the foundations in Europe and Asia Minor are known to have been (or were intended to be) royal residences: DEMETRIAS in Thessaly, LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, Pergamon NIKOMEDEIA, ARSINOE Ephesos, EUPATORIA Amisos, and APAMEIA Kelainai. In fact Kelainai had been chosen by Alexander to be the capital of the satrapy of Phrygia. Furthermore the Attalids maintained a palace at Tralleis. EUSEBEIA near Argaios was the residence of a royal official, and ILION was the center of the Federation of the Troad. Finally, we should bear in mind that the creation or expansion of cities resulted in a commensurate reduction of royal land, simplifying the administrative burden on the central authorities. The larger urban units were also undoubtedly more economically viable.<ref target="fnd0e5764" type="fnoteref">113</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Temples and shrines were centers of influence and wealth. The donations Hellenistic monarchs made to various festivals, the recognition as "crowned" or inviolable that they gave to festivals and temples, all attest to this. Such donations were another means, incidentally, by which the king could proclaim and advertise his philhellenism. Thus, in the course of recognizing the inviolability of the temple of Asklepios at Kos, Ziaëlas of Bithynia wrote to the Koans that "we pay attention to all the Greeks who come to us since we believe that this contributes in no small way to one's reputation" (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 25. 11-17).</p>

               <p>It is not surprising, therefore, to find that many of the Hellenistic settlements were built at or near major religious centers or were the sites of especially well known temples. Thus ANTIOCH near Pisidia, APOLLONIA Salbake, and SELEUKEIA on the Kalykadnos were all near well-known religious centers. ILION was home to an important temple of Athena, Ephesos (ARSINOE) was famous for its temple of Artemis, and KOLOPHON had within its territory Klaros and the oracle of Apollo.<ref target="fnd0e5792" type="fnoteref">114</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far I have not alluded to Hellenization as a motive because I do not think any of the kings had that as a primary consideration. It is true, of course, that in his speech to the Macedonians at Opis Alexander, referring to his father, said: "Philip found you poor wanderers, most of you clothed in sheepskins .... Philip gave you cloaks to wear instead of sheepskins, brought you down from the hills to the plains .... He made you dwellers of cities and civilized you with good laws and customs." (Arr. <hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 7.9.2). We should not, however, be misled by this speech. Philip moved the Macedonians not to civilize them but rather to control them. His motive had to do with security, not culture. Civilizing would possibly have been a by-product of this process, but one should not confuse the by-product with the purpose. "Civilizing" or "Hellenizing" was not, per se, the purpose of any of the Hellenistic kings in founding colonies. On the other hand, a number of ancient authors make clear that civilizing or Hellenizing was a <hi rend="italic">result</hi> of colonization. In talking about Alexander's achievement Plutarch pointed to the civilizing aspect: "By founding more than seventy cities among the barbarian tribes and by spreading Greek magistracies over Asia, Alexander overcame its wild and uncivilized way of life" (<hi rend="italic">De Alex. fort</hi> . 1.328E). Appian, Ammianus Marcellinus, and Libanius emphasized the role of Seleukos as a builder of cities in the East:</p>
               <q rend="blockquote">
                  <p>He [Seleukos] founded cities throughout the length of the whole empire and named sixteen of them Antioch for his father, five Laodokeia for his mother, nine for himself, four after his wives, three Apameias and one Stratonikeia. The most famous of these even now are the two Seleukeias, the one by the sea and the other on the Tigris River, Laodikeia in Phoenicia, Antioch under Mount Lebanon, and Apameia in Syria. The other cities he gave names from Greece or Macedonia, for his own deeds or in honor of King Alexander. As a result the names of many Greek and Macedonian towns are to be found in Syria and the barbarous regions of upper Asia, such as Beroia, Edessa, Perinthos, Maroneia, Kallipolis, Achaia, Pella, Oropos, Amphipolis, Arethousa, Astakos, Tegea, Chalkis, Larissa, Heraia, and Apollonia; in Parthia Soteira, Kalliope, Chaffs, Hekatompylos, Achaia; in India</p>

Moreover, if one should wish to compare him with the Athenians and Milesians, who are supposed to have sent out the greatest number of colonies, he would appear to be the greater colonizer, for he so much outstripped each of them in the magnitude of his works that one of his cities was worth ten of theirs. One can go to Phoenicia to see his cities, one can go to Syria and see even more and greater cities of his. He extended this noble work up to the Euphrates and the Tigris; and surrounding Babylon with cities, he scattered them everywhere, even in Persia. In short, there was no place suitable to receive a city that he left bare; rather, by Hellenizing the barbarian world he brought it to an end. (Lib. <hi rend="italic">Or</hi> . 11.101-3)</p>
               </q>
               <p>What emerges from reading these passages is the tremendous effect that the settlement foundings had on the ancient world. What was said about Alexander and Seleukos and their colonization of the East could equally be said about the other kings in other parts of the Hellenistic world and especially in Asia Minor. In Asia Minor alone, over one hundred settlements were founded or refounded in the Hellenistic period. According to Pausanias (10.4.1) a town could not be considered a polis unless it at least had magistracies, a gymnasium, a theater, and an agora. Hellenistic colonization spread these institutions—and the settlements that bore them—throughout Asia Minor and the rest of the Middle East.</p>
               <p>To understand the impact of the settlement foundings it is useful to revert briefly to the fifth and fourth centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> At that time all of Asia was under the tutelage of the Persian Empire. The Persian king was <hi rend="italic">the King</hi> , as all students of Xenophon learn. The threat, potential or actual, of the Persian Empire was a motif that ran through Greek political thinking. In the fifth century Herodotus began his account of the Persian Wars by recounting the history of east-west conflict and tracing it to before the Trojan War! In the fourth century the humiliation of the King's Peace in 387 had allowed the King to reassert control over the Greek cities of Asia Minor. Alexander's</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_68" n="68"/>
               <p>conquest of the King removed, once and for all, the Persian (i.e., Eastern) threat. However, it did more than that. It opened a vast, new world and made possible the colonization of this world. So it was that Greeks and Macedonians were brought to the remotest parts of Asia Minor, Asia, and Egypt. They brought with them Greek culture and Greek civic life. But they brought this to the settlements, not the countryside, and probably never attempted to reach out to the native population beyond those living in the cities. In short the colonists remained an exclusive and exclusionary element in an essentially foreign environment. There <hi rend="italic">was</hi> Hellenization among the native peoples. But it was probably limited mainly to the upper classes in the cities, and it was spontaneous. The experience of the Jews in Jerusalem leading up to the Hasmonean revolution is a good example of this.</p>
               <p>The HellenizedJews were very much the upper class of society. And it was they, not Antiochos IV Epiphanes, who initiated the pressure for Hellenization and reforms.<ref target="fnd0e5845" type="fnoteref">115</ref> According to the author of I Maccabees, "in those days there went out from Israel lawless men, and they persuaded many, saying, 'Let us go and make a covenant with the nations around us, because ever since we separated from them much evil has overtaken us.' The plan was good in their eyes. Then some of the people were zealous and they went to the King and he gave them authority to keep the ordinances of the nations. And they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to the customs of the nations" (1.11-13). The parallel account in 2 Maccabees 4.9-15 also mentions, among other things, the building of the gymnasium. Furthermore it indicates that the leader of the Hellenizers was a new high priest, Jason, that the other priests, now disdainful of the temple service, hurried to the gymnasium, and that the "best of the young men" (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00036.gif"/>) followed along. The resistance to these changes came from outside Jerusalem. Its leader was Mattathias, whom the author of t Maccabees describes as a member of a priestly clan from Jerusalem who had settled in the foothills of Judaea in Modin (2.1). Furthermore, when his son, Judah, began organizing active opposition to Antiochos IV and the Hellenizing program he went to the villages (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00037.gif"/> 2 Macc. 8.1) to build up his support. The <hi rend="italic">pagani</hi> were always the most conservative, whether they lived in the Roman or the Seleucid empire.</p>
               <p>Tarn and Griffith have suggested that the Hellenistic and especially the Seleucid scheme of colonization failed because the settlers "did not go out on</p>

               <p>the land" and that as a result the Asiatics never became Hellenized.<ref target="fnd0e5890" type="fnoteref">116</ref> This charge assumes that Alexander and the Hellenistic dynasts, like the British raj in India, wanted to convert the native population. This assumption is unfounded. As best as one can see, the <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> of the various colonizing programs was military, economic, or political, not cultural. The primary motive of the king in founding colonies was to establish a Greco-Macedonian presence at a particular site and to maintain it. The Greco-Macedonian settlers did not go out on the land. They probably had no desire to go, nor did the kings particularly want this.<ref target="fnd0e5898" type="fnoteref">117</ref> Except for the Antigonids, all the other dynasts were ruling foreign territories that had no Greco-Macedonian core or substratum. In order to anchor their rule they had to assert their presence by the creation of settlements whose names and populations constantly reminded one and all of the power of the ruling house. At the same time, the encouragement of a Hellenic <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00038.gif"/>, especially through the cultivation of the gymnasium as well as Greek civic life and ruler cult, reinforced the settlers in their identity and their loyalty to the royal house. The unhappiness of Alexander's colonists in the upper satrapies, who rebelled against Perdikkas because of a lack of Hellenic <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00039.gif"/>, was an object lesson not lost on any of the Successors (Diod. 18.7.1).</p>
               <p>For the Successors Hellenization meant fostering Hellenic culture primarily within the new settlements.<ref target="fnd0e5905" type="fnoteref">118</ref> As a result, from the perspective of Plutarch, Appian, and Libanius the kings did Hellenize and civilize the East, because now a Greek could travel anywhere in Asia Minor or Asia and find Greek magistracies, gymnasia, theaters, and agoras. For the Greeks of the Hellenistic and Roman world the significance of the settlements was clear: they were the means whereby the barbarian world was, in Libanius' words, "Hellenized" and "brought to an end." But for Libanius Hellenization of the East did not mean the conversion of the East. Rather it meant the extension of Greek institutions to settlements in the region. And the same was undoubtedly true for Asia Minor. Whether the surrounding population was affected by the new polls culture was of little consequence.

                  <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was the Hellenization of the Maddie East. In short, if by "Hellenization" we mean the permanent conversion of the Middle East, then the Hellenistic colonies failed. If, on the other hand, by the term we mean—as did Plutarch and Libanius—the founding of Greek settlements throughout the East and the spread of Greek culture <hi rend="italic">to these settlements</hi> , then the Hellenistic colonies succeeded admirably. In describing the Middle East that Xenophon and his cohorts encountered, A. H. M. Jones commented that "the <hi rend="italic">Anabasis</hi> shows the Greek cities farther east were islets of civilization in a barbarian ocean."<ref target="fnd0e5949" type="fnoteref">119</ref> A century later the same would be true of the Hellenistic colonies.</p>
               <p>The prominence in the Hellenistic period of cities that were Hellenistic foundations or refoundations is a good measure of the success of the various settlement programs. Two of the most important cities of the Hellenistic and Roman world, Antioch on the Orontes and Alexandreia, were new foundations. The latter city shared with Pergamon the distinction of being among the great centers of culture in the Hellenistic world. The Peace of Apameia, which permanently removed the Seleucids from Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains, was signed at the Seleucid settlement. Numerous Hellenistic foundations and refoundations appear on the Delphic <hi rend="italic"> theorodokoi</hi> list of c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> and later in 81 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> among the cities that recognized the inviolability of the temple of Hekate at STRATONIKEIA in Caria (itself a Hellenistic colony).<ref target="fnd0e5957" type="fnoteref">120</ref> We also see Hellenistic foundations exchanging <hi rend="italic">isopoliteia</hi> , and their citizens acting as judges in international disputes.<ref target="fnd0e5975" type="fnoteref">121</ref> A number of foundations were the sites of royal mints, while still more</p>

               <p>Livy (37.54.18) in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> , Tacitus (<hi rend="italic">Ann</hi> . 6.42) in the early second century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> , and Cassius Dio (40.16) in the early third century <hi rend="smallcaps"> A.D.</hi> all attest to the continued vitality and Greco-Macedonian character of the settlements. Furthermore, Christianity was nurtured in many of these settlements. In his travels Paul of Tarsos (which was itself refounded as an Antioch) visited many such cities, including Antioch on the Orontes, ANTIOCH near Pisidia, Ephesos (ARSINOE), and THESSALONIKE. The seven "Churches of Asia" (Rev. 1.11) were located in cities of Asia Minor that had been founded or refounded in the Hellenistic period: PERGAMON, Smyrna (EURYDIKEIA), Ephesos (ARSINOE), LAODIKEIA, PHILADELPHEIA, SARDIS, and THYATEIRA. The first great council of the Church was, of course, held at NIKAIA and was convened by an emperor who, in refounding Byzantion as Constantinople, was following good, Hellenistic tradition.</p>
               <p>To the criticism that the Hellenistic colonization of the Middle East ultimately failed one may answer that time and contemporary witnesses give proof of its success. It is true that by the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> Ammianus Marcellinus could remark that the old native town names were being used, supplanting the Greek toponyms imposed when the settlements were founded by Seleukos (14.8.6). But this was five to six hundred years after the colonies had been founded! The extraordinary thing is that so many of the settlements remained identifiably Greek for so long. One is reminded of the (apocryphal?) anecdote told about Charles de Gaulle's visit to Stalingrad. After viewing the war-torn city he remarked, "<hi rend="italic">Formidable, formidable.</hi> " When his Russian hosts asked, "What, <hi rend="italic">mon général?</hi> " de Gaulle replied, "Ah, that the Germans should have come so far."</p>

               <p>Stephanos (s.v. "Antigoneia") and Livy (32.5.9) place Antigoneia in Chaonia; Polybius located it in Atintania (see Walbank's comment on Polyb. 2.5.6 and 2.11.11). The former attribution is more likely (Hammond, <hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> [1966] 53-54; id., <hi rend="italic">Epirus</hi> , 578, 617, 679; but cf. P.

The—admittedly subjective—dating of the walls to the early third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (above, note 4) supports the identification of Pyrrhos as the founder.

Hammond, noting that Berat "is built on a steep hill on both sides of the narrow gorge of the river Osum," concurred with the general acceptance of the identification of the site. Hammond found a few pieces of Macedonian foundation courses there and reported the discovery of traces of fire in the remains. The founder of the town may have been Kassandros, who will have named it in memory of his father, Antipater. The founding date is also unknown. If Kassandros was the founder, we can likewise suggest that he founded it after he came into possession of Illyria, around 314 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>

The "Chersonese of Epirus" is the peninsula of Preveza; Berenike was probably located at the site of the harbor village of Kastrosikia, which is, according to Hammond, a four-hour walk north of the town of Preveza.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>

Dakaris, <hi rend="italic">Cassopaia and the Elean Colonies</hi> (Athens, 1971) 103; Garoufalias, <hi rend="italic">Pyrrhus</hi> , 244-45.</p>
               <p>1. Plutarch actually gives "Berenikis" as the name of the town (<hi rend="italic">Pyrrh</hi> . 6.1); this form is not found elsewhere (see A. B. Nederlof, <hi rend="italic">Plutarchus' Leven van Pyrrhus</hi> [Amsterdam, 1940] 29). Stephanos (s.v. "Berenike 1") says the town was founded by "Pyrrhos the Younger." Hammond suggests that the town was named both to honor Pyrrhos' mother-in-law and to commemorate the landing of Egyptian forces at his restoration in 297 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Epirus</hi> , 579).</p>
               <p>2. Appian (<hi rend="italic">Mith</hi> . 1.4) records a meeting at Berenike of the Bithynian prince Nikomedes, the Bithynian envoy Menas, and the Attalid envoy Andronikos, the purpose of which was to secure the throne for Nikomedes: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00040.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00041.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00042.gif"/>. The question is, which Berenike is meant? The most likely interpretation is that the three, who were on their way back to Asia from Rome, met at Berenike in Epirus after crossing over from Italy (thus Hansen, <hi rend="italic"> Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 137; Lévêque, 122; and Horace White in the Loeb edition). However, Hammond objects because "in the sequel of the story they go to Attalus and this context shows the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00043.gif"/> here is the mainland of Asia Minor" (<hi rend="italic">Epirus</hi> , 579 n. 1). However, Appian provides no indication as to how much time elapsed between the acclamation of Nikomedes and his meeting with Attalos. Furthermore, I know of no Berenike on the Asia Minor coast where they could have met. (BERENIKE in Cilicia was too far east. BERENIKE on Chios was apparently founded by Mithridates Eupator long after the events described by Appian.) Hammond also suggests (p. 657) that a Berenike recorded in the Delphic <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list (dated to c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ; see ANTIGONEIA Mantineia) is "probably in Cyrenaica but ... may be the place in ... Epirus." It is certainly the Cyrenaican city. In the <hi rend="italic"> theorodokoi</hi> list the four cities of Cyrenaica are listed in an east-to-west progression: Cyrene, Ptolemais, Arsinoe, Berenike (A. Plassart, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 45 [1921] 21, col. IV.19, and p. 62).</p>
               <p>3. For the probable <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of Berenike at Kastrosikia see Hammond, <hi rend="italic">Epirus</hi> , 49, 578-79, and map on p. 47. Cf. Dakaris (103) who places it at Michalitsi (also Cabanes, 508). Philippson and Kirsten (<hi rend="italic">Gr. Land</hi> ., 2.1: 109-10; but cf. 284 n. 34) suggest ("vielleicht") the town of Preveza. Oberhummer (<hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Berenike 2," followed by Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 137 n. 1) and Garoufalias (244) believe that Berenike was the site of the later Nikopolis. Tscherikower's suggestion (5) of Aktion is most</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_78" n="78"/>
               <p>unlikely. According to Kienast (<hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Pyrrhos," 119) Pyrrhos planned to make Berenike his capital; he changed his mind after the annexation of Ambrakia and made the latter his capital instead.</p>

               <p>In describing the Roman siege in 189 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> of Ambrakia, the capital of Pyrrhos' kingdom, both Polybius (21.27.2) and Livy (38.5.2 and 6.1) refer to attacks launched against the "Pyrrheion." Unfortunately the references do not make clear what the "Pyrrheion" was or where it was located. It has been suggested that this was either a fortified palace that Pyrrhos built as an extension to Ambrakia or a whole new fortified settlement—which possibly included a palace added on to the city.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> On the other hand, throughout the Hellenistic world there were numerous sacred precincts named after the person honored or buried there. It is more likely, therefore, that the Pyrrheion was a <hi rend="italic">temenos</hi> that probably contained the tomb of Pyrrhos.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>

               <p>1. Garoufalias suggested (33 and 247) that the Pyrrheion was a palace that gave its name to the new settlement; Hammond believed (<hi rend="italic">Epirus</hi> , 145 and 584) it was a "fortified suburb" (followed by Walbank, <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi> ., 3: 124). The precise location of the palace/suburb (if in fact the Pyrrheion was either of these) is not definitely known; see further Hammond, 145-48 (map, p. 141); Garoufalias, 247-48.</p>
               <p>2. For the suggestion that the Pyrrheion was the monument that held Pyrrhos' ashes see, for example, Beloch (<hi rend="italic">GG</hi>

Habicht has also suggested the Pyrrheion was a <hi rend="italic">tanenos</hi> and has noted the analogy with other <hi rend="bold">sacred precincts</hi> : thus, for example, the Amynteion at Pydna (schol. to Dem. <hi rend="italic">Olynth</hi> . 1.5 [ed. Dindorf, <hi rend="italic"> Demosthenes</hi> VIII (Oxford, 1851) 45]; Habicht, <hi rend="italic">Gott</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 11), the Alexandreion at PRIENE, the Ptolemaion at Rhodes (Diod. 20. 100.3; Habicht, <hi rend="italic"> Gott</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 109), the Lysimacheion at LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace, the Eumeneion at PHILETAIREIA, the Diodoreion at Pergamon (see under PHILETAIREIA), the Laodikeion at SARDIS, the Arateion at Sikyon (DEMETRIAS), the Prepelaion north of KOLOPHON, and the Nikatoreion at Seleukeia in Pieria (App. <hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 63).</p>

               <p>Agathopolis is known only from a series of coins dated by scholars to c. 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and from some references in later Byzantine texts.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The numismatic evidence consists of bronze coins that have a young male head bound with a fillet on the obverse, and an owl, double owl, laurel wreath, caduceus, or olive crown with the legend A<hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> A, A<hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> A<hi rend="Symbol">Q</hi> , or A<hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> A<hi rend="Symbol">Q</hi> O on the reverse.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> It is possible that Lysimachos named Agathopolis for his son, Agathokles.

A coin attributed by Wroth to Agathopolis (<hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1896] 88, no. 3) in fact belongs to Elaia (Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">ZfN</hi> 20 [1897] 281). Most of the above, as well as Babelon (<hi rend="italic">Traité de monnaies</hi> [1927] 4: 990) and Jones (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> , 3), followed Borrell, who suggested the five coins he published were from the Agathopolis mentioned by George Pachymeres and that the city was located in or near the Thracian Chersonese. The problem is that no city of this name was known in that area (see, for example, U. Kahrstedt, <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur Geschichte der thrakischen Chersones</hi> [Baden-Baden, 1954] 39 n. 111). Borrell also suggested that the city was named for Agathokles.</p>
               <p>There was, however, an Agathopolis on the Black Sea coast of what is now southern Bulgaria. While referring to Pachymeres (<hi rend="italic">De Mich. Palaeologo</hi> 5.4), Borrell did not notice that the Byzantine author grouped it with Sozopolis (ancient Apollonia, on the Black Sea coast) and Kanstritzi (north of the coastal town of Varna/Odessos). Furthermore, the <hi rend="italic">Notitiae</hi> place it in the archdiocese of Adrianople, between Sozopolis and Develtos (west of Sozopolis). In 1948 a native of Agathopolis, E. G. Bapheus, published a book (op. cit.) that covered the city's history from ancient times to its almost complete destruction in 1918 (the</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_82" n="82"/>
               <p>present Bulgarian town at the site is Ahtopol). In a brief section on the city in antiquity, Bapheus placed the coins with A<hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> A<hi rend="Symbol">Q</hi> O, etc., at the Byzantine-modern Agathopolis. For the dating of the coinage to c. 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> see, for example, Head, Gaebler, and Robert, <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> (1959) 175.</p>
               <p>3. For the <hi rend="bold">identification of Agathopolis with Ahtopol</hi> see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> (1959) 172-75; H. J. Kissling, <hi rend="italic"> Beiträge zur Kenntnis Thrakiens im</hi> 17. <hi rend="italic">Jahrhundert</hi> (Wiesbaden, 1956) 70; Mihailov, in <hi rend="italic">IGB</hi> I<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , p. 401. Bapheus identified the coinage with Agathopolis/Ahtopol but provided no argumentation for so doing (61-67; cf. Robert, <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> [1959] 234-35). L. Robert claimed that the coinage with A<hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> A<hi rend="Symbol">Q</hi> O, etc., belongs not with the Thracian city but rather to a previously undetected Agathopolis or AGATHOKLEIA in Mysia (<hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> [1959] 175-78); his arguments, however, are weak, and this identification must be considered speculative; see AGATHOKLEIA.</p>

               <p>In 340 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Alexander, acting as regent of Macedonia for his father, subdued a rebellion by the tribe of the Maidoi. Plutarch says (<hi rend="italic">Alex</hi> . 9) that after capturing the city he expelled the barbarians, settled a "mixed population" (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00045.gif"/>) in it, and called it Alexandropolis. The name is analogous to Philippopolis and was probably given on the instruction or, at the very least, with the permission of Philip. The territory of the Maidoi extended along the middle and upper Strymon River, and presumably it was somewhere in this region that Alexandropolis was located.</p>

               <p>Stephanos refers to this foundation as an "Alexandreia" (s.v. no. 3), on which see Tarn, 242. Tarn claims Alexandropolis was a military colony rather than a polis (248-49 and 249 n. 2, followed by J. R. Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">Plutarch, Alexander: A Commentary</hi> [Oxford, 1969] 23); contra, Hammond and Griffith, 558, who, correctly, question Tarn's assumption that a mixed population indicates a military colony.

               <p>Lysimacheia in the Thracian Chersonese was established by Lysimachos in 309 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and then refounded by Antiochos III in 196 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi>

               <p>The first settlement was built, according to Appian (<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 1), as a bulwark against the Thracian menace. Of course it also protected Lysimachos from Antigonos Monophthalmos. It included at least two nearby towns—Paktye and Kardia. Pausanias adds that in the course of the founding Kardia was destroyed (1.9.8). Presumably, as happened in similar instances elsewhere, the Kardians were moved to the site of the new settlement.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Justin mentions (17.1-2) that twenty-two years after its founding Lysimacheia was the victim of a major earthquake. In 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Seleukos Nikator, having crossed the Hellespont on his way to take possession of Lysimacheia, was murdered by Ptolemy Keraunos (App. <hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 62). The latter then proceeded to Lysimacheia, where he appeared wearing a diadem (Memnon, <hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 434 F8.3). According to Appian (<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 64), after Lysimachos died the inhabitants of the city buried him in a temple that they then called "the Lysimacheion." This suggests the establishment of a founder cult.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Under Lysimachos the city produced autonomous bronzes and had a royal mint. Posthumous issues of Lysimachos continued to appear for a generation after the king's death in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> The posthumous issues were followed by Seleucid tetradrachms apparently coined in each of the three short periods after the death of Seleukos I when the Seleucids were in Thrace: under Antiochos II (c. 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), Hierax (c. 227-226 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), and finally in the refounded city under Antiochos III (c. 196-190 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ). Lysimacheia was recorded on the Delphic <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list, which is now dated to c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , and was briefly occupied by Philip V at the end of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">3</hi> After he withdrew in 199/8 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , it fell to the Thracians, who destroyed it (Polyb. 18.4.5).</p>
               <p>The refounding of Lysimacheia is described in some detail both by Livy (33.38.10-11 and 40.6) and Appian (<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 1). From these authors we learn that Antiochos discovered the city abandoned and in ruins as a result of the recent sacking by Thracians. Appreciating its strategic location, the king decided to reestablish the city, both to gain control of Thrace as well as to provide a secure base for operations against the Romans. He repopulated it by calling back inhabitants who had fled and ransoming those who had been sold into slavery. He also invited new settlers and tried to entice them by various inducements. The king rebuilt walls and homes and provided sheep, cattle, and agricultural implements. In order to complete the project as expeditiously as possible Antiochos ordered half his army and all his naval allies to take part in the rebuilding. The other part of the army he took with him on an expedition to devastate the neighboring areas of Thrace. Finally, he declared that the rebuilt city would be a residence for his son, Seleukos (the future Seleukos IV Philopator; Polyb. 18.51.8; Livy 35.15.5).<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> In fact, when the false news of the death of the boy-king Ptolemy V caused Antiochos to break off the conference with the Romans at Lysimacheia in 196 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , he left Seleukos in charge of rebuilding the city (Livy 33.41.4-5).</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_84" n="84"/>
               <p>An inscription found at Ilion records a treaty between King Antiochos and Lysimacheia. We are probably concerned with Antiochos III. The king promises to uphold the city's [autonomy] and democracy, to keep it tribute-free and ungarrisoned, and to defend it if attacked. In his oath the king makes specific reference to the <hi rend="italic">phrouria</hi> and the harbor of the city. The Lysimacheians in turn swear to maintain the alliance with the king.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> Two other Hellenistic inscriptions, which are dedicated to the god, or hero, Anaios, contain lists of twelve <hi rend="italic">strategoi</hi> and are dated by an eponymous magistrate who was a priest.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Following the withdrawal of Antiochos from Europe Lysimacheia apparently once more fell into decay. In the late first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.47; cf. Paus. 1.10.4) described it as practically deserted. Lysimacheia was most probably located at Ortaköy in the Thracian Chersonese.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi>

For the inclusion of Paktye in the new foundation see Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.48. Stephanos' comment (s.v.

Despite Pausanias' assertion that Kardia was destroyed when Lysimacheia was founded, it did not disappear (see, for example, Appian, Ptolemy, and Strabo): either the town was not totally destroyed or, if it was, it was subsequently rebuilt on a lesser scale. Note that in his description of the founding of ARSINOE Ephesos Pausanias says (1.4.7) that Lysimachos destroyed Kolophon and Lebedos in order to populate the new city. In fact we know that both cities were in existence afterward. On the question of the "destruction" of a city and the various forms it could take see KOLOPHON.</p>

The assignment of these coins to Lysimacheia is rendered reasonably secure by the presence of the city's badge, a lion's head. On the other hand, the attribution of the coins to particular Seleucid monarchs is less secure. Newell attributed nos. 1610-13 to Antiochos II, 1614 (which may have been minted at Lampsakos) to Hierax, and 1615-21 to Antiochos III. Boehringer (<hi rend="italic">Zur Chronologie</hi> , 65, 161, no. 29) grouped nos. 1625-20 with Hierax and 1621 with Antiochos III. Houghton (<hi rend="italic">CSE</hi> , 61) attributed only coinage of Antiochos II and Hierax to Lysimacheia, though he later expressed agreement with the assignment of no. 1621 to Antiochos III (see Le Rider, <hi rend="italic"> QT</hi> 17 [1988] 200). Most recently Le Rider (<hi rend="italic">QT</hi> [1988] 195-207) modified Newell's attributions by reassigning nos. 1615-20 from Antiochos III to Antiochos II. Le Rider noted (200-201) the discovery of two hoards, one dated to c. 245-235 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Gülnar: A. Davesne, <hi rend="italic">CRAI</hi> [1981] 356-70; see now Davesne and Le Rider, <hi rend="italic">Meydancikkale</hi> 227-30) and the other dated to c. 246 or a little later (Tel Halaf: <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1763), and pointed out that "deux exemplaires du <hi rend="italic"> WSM</hi> 1615-1620 figurent dans le trésor (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi> . of Meydancikkale)." This excluded the attribution of these coins to Antiochos III. The assignment of nos. 1610-13 as well as 1615-20 to Antiochos II indicates a significant minting and reflects Antiochos' active presence in the region; see also ANTIOCH in the Propontis; J. Youroukova, in <hi rend="italic">Studia Naster</hi> , 120ff.</p>
               <p>Gardner's suggestion (<hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1878] 92-93, followed by Babelon, <hi rend="italic">RdS</hi> , XXXVII, XLIX) that Antiochos I may have minted coins in Europe is very uncertain (see Beloch, <hi rend="italic">GG</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 4.2: 356); neither Newell (<hi rend="italic">WSM</hi> , 354) nor Houghton (<hi rend="italic">CSE</hi> , 61) assign any coins to him.

Gauthier (<hi rend="italic">JS</hi> [1981] 327-45) in a very thorough discussion questioned this identification on both historical and palaeographic grounds.

               <pb id="JD_Page_86" n="86"/>
               <p>In the first place they point out that while King Antiochos swore to preserve the [autonomy] and freedom of the city and to keep it free of a garrison and of tribute (ll. 13-15), the literary evidence indicates that in 196 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Antiochos III's son remained at Lysimacheia with an army (Livy 33.41.4) and that in 190, under pressure, Antiochos ordered the garrison (<hi rend="italic">praesidium</hi> ) withdrawn from Lysimacheia (Livy 37.31.1). However, it is well known that in the Hellenistic world the gap between theory and practice when it came to matters such as the granting or guaranteeing of freedom and autonomy was immense. It would be naive to think that just because the king granted these conditions he actually lived by them—or intended to. In the second place Ferrary and Gauthier claim that the two fragments that make up this inscription do not belong to the same stele (350ff.). Their arguments are based on a consideration of the letterforms—a highly subjective criterion at best, especially as Tasliklioglu<ref target="d0e4679" type="fnoteref">*</ref>

                  </note> and Frisch have claimed on the basis of the letterforms and length of lines that the two fragments belong to the same stele (103). Given the known fact of Antiochos' presence at Lysimacheia and his (and his son's) involvement with the city, it appears most likely—in the present state of the evidence—that he is the "King Antiochos" in the treaty with Lysimacheia.</p>
               <p>For the earlier treaty between Philip V and Lysimacheia (<hi rend="italic">Staats</hi> . III.549, c. 202-199/8 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ) see D. Pandermalis, <hi rend="italic">Studies Edson</hi> , 285-86.</p>

               <p>7. <hi rend="bold">Location</hi> . The various literary sources indicate that Lysimacheia was in the middle of the Chersonesos, surrounded by Paktye on the Propontis and Kardia on the Melas Gulf (e.g., Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.48; Strabo 7, frags. 51, 53), and that Pausanias (second century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ) saw the grave of Lysimachos, which Appian (<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 64) says was in Lysimacheia, at a spot between Paktye and Kardia (1.10.4). Nevertheless the precise site of Lysimacheia has not yet been identified with certainty. Some MSS of Ptolemy (3.11.7) place it at Hexamilion (the modern Ortaköy; see Müller's note: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00047.gif"/> "inepte adsunt"); this is followed, for example, in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. Geog.</hi> s.v. "Lysimachia." Casson (<hi rend="italic">Macedonia, Thrace and Illyria</hi> [Oxford, 1928] map opposite p. 211; also p. 225) places it on the Melas Gulf near Kardia. But Walbank (<hi rend="italic">Comment</hi> ., 2: 478) cited Appian (<hi rend="italic">BCiv</hi> . 4.88), who says Kardia and Lysimacheia protected the entrance to the Chersonesos "like gates"; this suggests, as Walbank remarks, "that one stood on or near either side" (sc. of the isthmus). One hypothesis would place Lysimacheia near the Hellespont and in the vicinity of Bolayir. This location was first suggested by L. Robert (<hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 5 [1948] 51-54 and 10 [1955] 266-71); subsequently D. Hereward identified the nearby Sukrüler Tepe as the actual site of the town (<hi rend="italic">Archaeology</hi> 11 [1958] 129 and map). On the other hand, in a recent, extensive study of the problem Kai Brodersen reverted to the citation in Ptolemy and suggested Hexamilion (Ortaköy)</p>

               <p>According to Livy (44.10.8), Antigoneia was a town near the south coast of Chalcidice, located between Aineia and the peninsula of Pallene. It is recorded in the Delphic <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list (A. Plassart, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 45 [1921] 18, col. III.76) between Aineia and Kassandreia and is also mentioned by ps.

               <p>1. There are <hi rend="bold">two other epigraphic attestations for an Antigoneia</hi> — undoubtedly the Chalcidian rather than the Paeonian one: L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> (1939) 144 and <hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 441.182-83 (= <hi rend="italic">I. Strat</hi> . 508.40-41: an "Antigoneia in Macedonia" included in a list of cities recognizing the inviolability of the temple of Hekate at Stratonikeia in Caria from 81 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ). Similarly, Stephanos records an Antigoneia of Macedonia (s.v. no. 3) that he says was a foundation of Antigonos Gonatas. It is not clear whether this refers to the Chalcidian or the Paeonian one. However, if, as appears likely, Papazoglou is correct in her claim (<hi rend="italic">The Central Balkan Tribes in Pre-Roman Times</hi> [Amsterdam, 1978] 145-46) that Paeonia first came under Antigonid rule when Doson conquered it, then Stephanos' reference can only be to the Chalcidian city.</p>
               <p>Under Macedonia Ptolemy mentions Antigoneia Psaphara (3.12.35) and Antigoneia of Mygdonia (3.12.33). At 3.12.35 Ptolemy writes <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00048.gif"/>, <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00049.gif"/>. It has generally been assumed that this Antigoneia was the Chalcidian one and that Psaphara was either its earlier name (so, for example, Tscherikower, 3) or an adjective, "sandy" (L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> [1939] 145-46). Papazoglou, on the other hand, noted that at 3.12.35 Antigoneia Psaphara is grouped with Moryllos and Klitai and is listed under Paraktia. She remarked that whereas earlier it was assumed Moryllos and Klitai were Chalcidian towns, it is now clear that Moryllos was in the interior of Mygdonia in the region of Kilkis (<hi rend="italic">Villes</hi> , 323-24, 183). She also adopted the alternative reading <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00050.gif"/> for <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00051.gif"/>, suggested correcting <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00052.gif"/> to <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00053.gif"/> (i.e., <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00054.gif"/>). As a result she posited that Antigoneia Psaphara was, in fact, Antigoneia on the Axios. See also ANTIGONEIA in Paeonia.</p>
               <p>Among those living in Macedonia Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.12) mentions the ANTIOCHIENSES. Jones (<hi rend="italic">Creek City</hi> , 306 n. 12) and Papazoglou (<hi rend="italic">Villes</hi> , 420) have both raised the possibility that this was an error for Antigonenses. Papazoglou would apparently</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_92" n="92"/>
               <p>associate the "Antigonenses" with Antigoneia in Chalcidice (Pliny does mention ANTIGONEIA in Paeonia at <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.34). This is, of course, speculation.</p>

L. Robert (<hi rend="italic">REG</hi> 47 [1934] 31-36, esp. 36 and n. 7) correctly connected this town with the tribe of the Antanoi.

               <p>Under Macedonia Ptolemy mentions Antigoneia of Mygdonia (3.12.33) and Antigoneia Psaphara (3.12.35). Some scholars have suggested that by the former Ptolemy meant Antigoneia in Paeonia (so, for example, Tscherikower, 2). However, Mygdonia did not extend that far north. This prompted L. Robert to reject Ptolemy's reference to Antigoneia being in Mygdonia (<hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> [1939] 144-45). Papazoglou, noting that in his enumeration Ptolemy lists Kalindoia immediately after Antigoneia of Mygdonia, suggested that under this heading Ptolemy in fact meant ANTIGONEIA in Chalcidice (<hi rend="italic">Villes</hi> , 324). For other references to an Antigoneia in Macedonia that may refer either to this or to the Chalcidian city see ANTIGONEIA in Chalcidice.</p>

Hammond (op. cit., 174) suggested Antigoneia may have been near Banja. Since the Peutinger Table gives XII miles as the distance from Stobi to Antigoneia, while the distance of the former to Banja is approximately 25 km, Hammond suggested emending the text from XII to XVII (172; on errors in the Peutinger Table see Pritchett, <hi rend="italic">Topography</hi> , 3: 202 and n. 20); cf. G. I. Kazarow (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 47 [1923] 299-300), who thought Antigoneia was at Negotino. Miller (<hi rend="italic">Itineraria Romana</hi> , 573) suggested Vojšanci; Papazoglou (<hi rend="italic">Villes</hi> , 326) opted for Budur Ciflik. On the location see also L. Heuzey and H.

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Antiochienses</head>
               <p>Among the people living in Macedonia, Pliny mentions the Antiochienses (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.35). We do not know who these were, where precisely they were located and, if they were descended from a Hellenistic settlement, who founded the colony.</p>
               <p>Jones (<hi rend="italic">Greek City</hi> , 306 n. 12) suggests either that the Antiochienses were named for Antiochos I Soter, the second husband of Stratonike and the brother-in-law of Antigonos Gonatas, or that the term is a mistake for Antigonenses. The first suggestion is unlikely. When Hellenistic monarchs gave personal names to settlements they usually named them for more immediate relatives; see, for example, Appian (<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 57), who says that Seleukos named cities for his father, mother, his wives, and himself; but cf. BERENIKE in Epirus, which Pyrrhos named for his mother-in-law. It is of course possible that Pliny made an error and that he meant Antigonenses (so Jones, op. cit., and Papazoglou, <hi rend="italic">Villes</hi> , 420). Note, however, that at section 34 he did mention ANTIGONEIA in Paeonia. In that case he used the toponym rather than the ethnic.</p>

               <p>A dedicatory inscription to Apollo (<hi rend="italic">SEG</hi> XXXVI.626) was found at Toumpes Kalamotou, the site of the ancient Kalindoia in the Chalcidic peninsula. It records a list of priests of Asklepios<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> who had fulfilled their duties "from the time when King Alexander (i.e., Alexander the Great) gave to '<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00060.gif"/>,' Kalindoia and the places (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00061.gif"/>) around Kalindoia—the territory of Thamiskos (?), Kamakai and Tripoiai" (ll. 5-10).<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> "Makedones" are the Macedonian people. It is probable, therefore, that this was a collective gift to "Makedones," made in order to allow for the establishment of a Macedonian city on the site of Kalindoia. Furthermore the new polis probably included the three other towns.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Vokotopoulou has demonstrated that the stele was probably set up in 323 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.G.</hi> Therefore the reorganization of Kalindoia probably took place in 335/4.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> We do not know whether the new city was called Kalindoia or had a new name.

               <p>3. According to Hammond (<hi rend="italic">CQ</hi> 82 [1988] 386) the term "Makedones" was being used in a general sense in the inscription. He noted that "<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00062.gif"/>," without the definite article, was often "used in a political context for the Macedonian people": for example, Hdt. 9.44.1; Thuc. 1.57.2; Paus. 10.8.2; Arr. <hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 1.27.4; 3.24.5, 26.2, 27.2; <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> I<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 89.60; M.

The inscription would thus explain the setting up of a list of priests that marked the beginning of a new era at the new Macedonian city.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Vokotopoulou (97) believed the inscription meant the recipients of Alexander's largesse were individual Macedonians. However, Hammond rightly objected that, among other things, the magnitude of the gift rendered it unlikely that it was made to individuals (<hi rend="italic">CQ</hi> [1988] 386).</p>
               <p>4. For the <hi rend="bold">dating of the inscription</hi> see Vokotopoulou (97), followed by E.

Vokotopoulou demonstrated (97-98) that the first nineteen lines— which included the record of the first ten priests—were inscribed by the same hand and that subsequent additions were made by different hands. Furthermore Vokotopoulou dated the whole inscription palaeographically to the period 330-300 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> This pointed to the period 330-320 as the time when the first ten names were inscribed by the same stonecutter, and the decade 340-330 for the beginning of the new era dated by the eponymous priests. Furthermore she suggested that Alexander made the gift during the winter of 335/4, i.e., between his return from Greece and his departure for Asia.

               <p>There is evidence for an eponymous priest at the end of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> who was also, very probably, a priest of the city founder(s) (<hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 332).

               <p>Kassandreians begin appearing throughout the Greek world very soon after the city's founding. In addition to <hi rend="italic">proxenia</hi> decrees for Kassandreians, there is also an inscription from Arcadia, c. 304/3 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , that mentions a Kassandreian victor in the horse race at Lykaia (<hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 314 B28).

In inscriptions and on coins the name is always spelled with two sigmas; in the literary evidence it appears both as "Kassandreia" (e.g., Strabo 7, frag. 27) and "Kasandreia" (e.g., Diod. 19.52.2).</p>
               <p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was thought by some scholars that Kassandreia had been renamed <hi rend="bold">"Eurydikeia"</hi> for a short period (Leake, <hi rend="italic">Num.

This suggestion was based on a passage in Polyaenus (6.7.2) that says Eurydike granted freedom to the city. However, Polyaenus then says that a festival, the "Eurydikeia," was established, not that the city was renamed "Eurydikeia" (on the festival see Habicht,</p>

               <p>According to Stephanos (s.v. "Phila"), Phila was founded in Macedonia by Demetrios II on the Peneios River and named for his mother. Phila was five miles from Herakleion (Livy 44.8.9) and occupied a strategic site at the entrance to the Vale of Tempe. Hammond locates it on the north bank of the Peneios, southeast of Piryetos.<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>

Leake (<hi rend="italic">NG</hi> , 3: 422) placed it near the mouth of the Peneios on the north bank; Hammond objects to this because it would locate Phila too far south to conform with Livy's information that it was five miles from Herakleion. L. Heuzey (<hi rend="italic">Le Mont Olympe et l'Acarnanie</hi> [Paris, 1860] 80f.) suggested it was located at the village of Piryetos, where he found some capitals and inscriptions. The strategic importance of Phila can be seen in the frequency with which it is mentioned in the course of Livy's narrrative of the war against Perseus: e.g., 44.2.12, 3.7, 8.1, 8.8, 34.10. According to Livy, Perseus left (<hi rend="italic">relinquit</hi> ) a small garrison force there (42.67.2). Furthermore it was an important supply depot (44.7.12); see further, Hammond and Walbank, <hi rend="italic">Macedonia</hi> , 3: 528-30.</p>
               <p>There is no <hi rend="bold">coinage</hi> that can definitely be ascribed to Phila. A bronze coin from the Roman period with the legend <hi rend="Symbol">F</hi> I<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> A, which Imhoof-Blumer attributed to Phila (<hi rend="italic">M.

               <p>The evidence for Stratonikeia in Chalcidice is severely limited. Ptolemy refers to a Stratonikeia that was located on the Singitic Gulf (3.12.9).

All of the above agree, as is most likely, that "Queen Stratonike" was Gonatas' sister. Cf., however, W.

Leake, noting the similarity of the ancient toponym to the name of the modern village of Stratoni and the presence of archaeological remains there, suggested (<hi rend="italic">NG</hi> , 3: 160) that Ptolemy erred in placing Stratonikeia on the Singitic Gulf and that in fact it was on the Strymonic Gulf (see Leake's map at the end of <hi rend="italic">NG</hi> 3); followed, for example, by Diehl and Cousin, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 9 (1885) 473, and Zahrnt, 244.

               <p>1. The <hi rend="bold">founding</hi> date of 316/5 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> for Kassandreia is fixed by Diod. 19.52.2 and the Marmor Parium (<hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 239 F B14). Furthermore Kassandros refounded THEBES in 316/5 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> This lends support to the notion that Kassandros likewise founded THESSALONIKE around the same time. For Thessalonike see Carney, 137 and n. 16; id., in <hi rend="italic">Women's History and Ancient History</hi> , ed. S. B. Pomeroy (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1991) 169 n. 42; W. L. Adams, <hi rend="italic"> Anc. Maced</hi> . (Thessaloniki, 1983) 3: 24 and n. 31. I am not convinced by E. I.

               <p>2. At 7, frag. 21 Strabo says that Kassandros destroyed (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00073.gif"/>) the towns involved in the synoecism and transferred (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00074.gif"/>) the inhabitants to the new foundation. Strabo mentions the names of six of the communities involved in the synoecism: Apollonia, Chalastra, Therme, Gareskos, Aineia, and Kissos (on these towns see Papazoglou, 198-201; Dion. Hal. also says that Kassandros destroyed Aineia and removed its inhabitants to Thessalonike, 1.49.4). At frag. 24 Strabo says</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_103" n="103"/>
               <p>that Thessalonike was the renamed Therme and adds that Kassandros transferred (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00075.gif"/>) the inhabitants to it. Despite the assertions about destruction and transfer, we know from other evidence that some of these towns continued to exist: for example, Apollonia (Livy 45.28.8; Acts 17.1), Aineia (Livy 44.10.7), Gareskos (Strabo 7, frag. 36; Ptol. 3.12.22). Chalastra is also mentioned elsewhere by Strabo (7, frags. 20 and 23), but here he may be reproducing a pre-Hellenistic source (see Edson, <hi rend="italic">CPh</hi> 42 [1947] 102 n. 101). Furthermore it is important to remember that the "destruction" of a city or town could take a number of forms, from the physical destruction of (parts of) the city or city wall to—more frequently—the deprivation of its rights as an autonomous body. On the "destruction" of cities see KOLOPHON. On the synoecism see also Papazoglou, <hi rend="italic">Villes</hi> , 189-90.</p>
               <p>Two other names are attested for Thessalonike: Halia and Emathia. Stephanos (s.v. "Thessalonike") and the <hi rend="italic">Etymologicum Magnum</hi> (s.v. "Thessalonike"), who give the <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> as Kassandros, say that the city had once been called Halia. This is our sole source of information about Halia. It is not clear whether the term was a name for a town or a region. A number of scholars have suggested the term was related to <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00076.gif"/> ("pertaining to the sea") and, for example, reflected the name given by inhabitants of the interior to the coastal city of Thessalonike (Tafrali, op. cit., 5) or the name of the coastal region before the founding of Thessalonike (Oberhummer, op. cit., 145); see further Papazoglou, <hi rend="italic">Villes</hi> , 195-96.</p>
               <p>Zonaras (<hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> . 12.26) comments that it had been known as Emathia. Papazoglou has plausibly suggested (196-98) that it may have been one of the towns included in the synoecism. Stephanos and the <hi rend="italic">Etym. Magnum</hi> , as well as Constant. Porphyr.

Gr.</hi> , 113: 120-21]), record a doubtful tradition that associated the name of the city with Philip II and a victory he gained over the Thessalians. Also doubtful is the assertion of the Heidelberg Epitome (<hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 155 F2.4) that Thessalonike herself founded the city.</p>
               <p>3. M. Vickers's observation that "the site of Therme and its relationship to Thessaloniki is one of the oldest problems of Macedonian topography" is quite correct. For full discussion of the problem and further references, see Vickers (<hi rend="italic">Studies Edson</hi> , 327-33) and G. Bakalakis (<hi rend="italic">AK</hi> Beiheft 1 [1958] 30-34), who favored the identification of Thessalonike and Therme; Hammond (<hi rend="italic">Macedonia</hi> , 1: 150-51) and Papazoglou (<hi rend="italic">Villes</hi> , 190-95), who rejected the identification; and C. Edson (<hi rend="italic">CPh</hi> 42 [1947] 100-104), who suggested Therme was "at, or very near, Salonica." See also K. A. Romaios, <hi rend="italic">Makedonika</hi> 1 (1940) 1-7 and map on p. 6.</p>

               <p>Macedonia fortified by Justinian. Obviously if it is the Therme of the archaic and classical periods, then it and Thessalonike will have been distinct. However, the precise identification of Procopius' Therme is not certain. Vickers, for example, suggests it was another city located some distance from Thessalonike (<hi rend="italic">CR</hi> 88 [1974] 10-11; <hi rend="italic">Studies Edson</hi> , 330). Note that Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.36) also says that Thessalonike and Therme were different cities. Hammond (op. cit.), on the basis of the fact that Pliny distinguishes between the two places, likewise separates them and postulates that the cape of Mikro Karaburnu was the site of Therme. For the (less likely) view that Therme was located at Sedhes (where there are warm springs), 10 km to the southeast, see Oberhummer, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.vv. "Therme," 2392, and "Thessalonike," 145; and the authors of the <hi rend="italic">ATL</hi> , 1: 546 (contra, Edson, 100-101). Romaios's view (op. cit.) that Therme was a collective name for a group of villages extending from the modern Thessalonike to Sedhes is not likely.</p>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Uranopolis</head>
               <p>Strabo (7, frag. 35) tells us that Alexarchos, the eccentric brother of King Kassandros, founded a city on Mount Athos and called it Uranopolis. Strabo adds that it had a circuit of thirty stades. Alexarchos, who called himself the Sun, invented a new language for his city; Athenaeus records an indecipherable letter in this dialect that he sent to Kassandreia (3.98d-f). The date of the founding is not known but was probably around 316 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , which is the period when Kassandros founded Thessalonike and Kassandreia and restored Thebes.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> We do not know how long the new toponym lasted.</p>
               <p>The coins of Uranopolis are interesting. They bear the legend <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00082.gif"/>
                  <hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> O<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> E<hi rend="Symbol">WS</hi> , "of the city of the Uranids" (bronze), and <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00083.gif"/> (bronze and a few silver), rather than <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00084.gif"/>, "citizens of Uranopolis." Aphrodite Urania is portrayed on the reverse, while the obverse bears a representation of the sun surrounded by rays or a sun and lunar crescent, sometimes with stars.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> It is possible that the mint at Uranopolis also produced posthumous Alexanders.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The location of Uranopolis has not yet been fixed. Some indication is given by Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.37), who enumerates the towns of the peninsula from northwest to southeast and begins with Uranopolis. His omission of Sane suggests that it may have been the site of Uranopolis. On the other hand, Uranopolis coins known to Leake were found in the vicinity of Akanthos (which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> mentioned by Pliny). Presumably Uranopolis was located at or near one of these towns.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>

Because of, among other things, their low weight, the authenticity of the autonomous tetradrachms was questioned by P. Lederer (<hi rend="italic">ZfN</hi> 41 [1931] 47-54). However, N. Breitenstein (<hi rend="italic">Acta Archaeologica</hi> 13 [1942] 248-50) argued for their authenticity. He pointed out that the low weight of the tetradrachms was in fact similar to the weight of late posthumous Philips (see also M. Thompson, <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 26 [1981] 43).</p>
               <p>3. The <hi rend="bold">attribution of some posthumous Alexander coinage, previously grouped by Müller with Amphipolis, Akrothooi, or designated as uncertain, to Uranopolis</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Numismatique d'Alexandre le Grand</hi> [Copenhagen, 1855] nos. 62, 66-75, 641-45, and possibly 151-78 as well; see now Price, <hi rend="italic">Alexander and Philip</hi> , 139f., nos. 509-23) was first made by Imhoof-Blumer (<hi rend="italic">M. Gr</hi> ., 97). Imhoof-Blumer based this attribution on the appearance of the A-torch as well as the pyramid surmounted by a star or the fulmen-I on certain Alexanders and on the coinage of Uranopolis. He was followed by, among others, Breitenstein (above, note 2); R. W. Mathisen, <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 26 (1981) 115; the <hi rend="italic">SNG Ashmolean Museum</hi> 2657-58; and <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (Cop) <hi rend="italic">Macedonia</hi> 697-708. The attribution, however, is not secure (so, for example, Price, <hi rend="italic">Alexander and Philip</hi> , 139 n. 3). A. R. Bellinger (<hi rend="italic">Essays on the Coinage of Alexander the Great</hi> [New York, 1963] 90), Thompson (<hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 26 [1981] 40-44), and Newell (see Thompson, <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> [1981] 40 n. 16) assigned this coinage to Amphipolis.</p>
               <p>4. On the <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of Uranopolis see the discussion by Imhoof-Blumer, 97-98. For the discovery of bronze coins at and near Erisso (the site of Akanthos) see Leake, <hi rend="italic">Num. Hell</hi> ., "European Greece," p. 109; id., <hi rend="italic">NG</hi> , 3: 148-49. Imhoof-Blumer also notes (98 n. 68) that Akanthos stopped minting shortly before the founding of Uranopolis and Sane apparently never minted. For the less likely identification of Uranopolis with Akrothooi at the tip of Athos see Head, <hi rend="italic">BMC Macedonia</hi> , xxxii.</p>
               <p>Tarn suggests (430) that the Macedonian Uranopolis colonized the like-named town in Pamphylia mentioned by Ptolemy (5.5.5). There is no extant evidence to support this contention. See also Wrist, <hi rend="italic"> RE</hi> s.v. "Uranopolis 2."</p>

               <p>1. Strabo actually refers to Konope as Konopa (10.2.22). There are three schools of thought regarding the circumstances of the <hi rend="bold"> founding</hi> . (1) Some scholars follow Strabo literally and claim that Arsinoe (or Ptolemy II Philadelphos) founded the city while she was the wife of Philadelphos, i.e., between 277 and 268 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (on the date of Arsinoe's death see ARSINOE Methana, note 4); see, for example, Droysen, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 2: 755; P. M. Fraser, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 78 (1954) 60 and n. 3; cf. Hirschfeld, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Arsinoe 15." Two objections may be raised against this view: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Aetolia never belonged to the Ptolemies, and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> all the other Ptolemaic Arsinoes were seaports. (2) Other scholars, pointing to the nearby town of Lysimacheia, suggest either that Arsinoe founded the town while she was the wife of Lysimachos or that Lysimachos himself did it; this would have to be after the latter's conquest of Macedonia and Pyrrhos' retreat to Epirus, i.e., between 284 and 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ; for Lysimachos as founder see, for example, Woodhouse, 214-19. The objections to this hypothesis are <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Lysimachos did not actually rule Aetolia, and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> Strabo specifics that Arsinoe was the wife of Philadelphos. The counterargument to the second point is that Strabo referred to her this way only as a means of identifying <hi rend="italic">which</hi> Arsinoe he meant. (3) Finally, it has been suggested that the Aetolians themselves founded the city and named it in honor of Arsinoe when she was the wife of Lysimachos (rather than when she was Ptolemy's wife), just as they founded Lysimacheia in his honor; see, for example, Tarn, <hi rend="italic">AG</hi> , 111; Beloch, <hi rend="italic">GG</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 4.1: 241 n. 2 (see also Flacelière, <hi rend="italic">Les Aitoliens</hi> , 81 n. 2); Tscherikower, 5; P.

Despite Strabo's explicit statement that <hi rend="bold">Arsinoe</hi> founded the town it is possible the Aetolians actually founded the city but considered her the "founder."</p>

We also get an indication of the location of Arsinoe at Angelokastron from the combined evidence of Strabo and Polybius. In addition to telling us that Konope was refounded as an Arsinoe, Strabo adds that it was near Lysimacheia and was "well situated at the ford of the Acheloos" (10.2.22). From Polybius we learn that in 219 and again in 218 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Philip V crossed the Acheloos (Aspropotamos) River at a spot near Konope. In 218 he crossed the river at a point between the towns of Stratos and Konope (5.6.6)—obviously the same "ford of the Acheloos" he had used in 219 (4.63.11, 64.5). Polybius also adds that after crossing the Acheloos in 218, Philip marched past Konope and the town of Lysimacheia (5.7.7). Finally, in the passage preserved by Athenaeus, Polybius refers to Arsinoe as being near a river called the Kyathos; this was apparently a tributary of the Acheloos (Aspropotamos) that flowed from the lake at Angelokastron (Polyb. 9.45.1 = Ath. 10.424c; see Walbank, <hi rend="italic"> Comment</hi> . on Polyb. 9.45.1; Woodhouse, 210; Leake, <hi rend="italic">NG</hi> , 1: 154; on the Lake Angelokastron [Lisimakhia] see <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Lysimacheia 2"). In fact, the modern village of Angelokastron is in southwestern Aetolia, west of the lake of the same name approximately 2 km from the Acheloos. (On Angelokastron see Soustal and Koder, <hi rend="italic">TIB</hi> III: 108 and map at end.) The ruins near the village are agreed to be those of Arsinoe Konope. Despite the fact that Stephanos places Arsinoe (s.v.) in Aetolia and Konope (s.v.) in Acarnania, there is no reason to doubt that the two were one and the same (so Woodhouse, 213 n. 4, against H. G. Lolling, "Hellenische Landeskunde," in <hi rend="italic">Müllers Handbuch</hi> [Nördlingen, 1889] 3: 139). See the map in Walbank, <hi rend="italic"> Comment</hi> ., 1: 542.</p>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Demetrias</head>
               <p>Demetrios Poliorketes founded Demetrias sometime after 294 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> According to Strabo (9.5.15) the new city was a synoecism consisting of the inhabitants of the towns of Nelia, Pagasai, Ormenion, Rhizous, Sepias, Olizon, Boibe, and Iolkos. At the time of the founding or later Aiole, Halos, Spalauthra, Korope, Kasthanaia, and Amphanai also were included. The strategic importance of the city was frequently noted in antiquity. It was a major fortress, which along with Chalkis and Korinth was considered to be one of the "fetters of Greece." Strabo noted (9.5.15) that the city controlled the Vale of Tempe as well as the mountains Pelion and Ossa and was a naval station. In 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> the Greek delegation to Rome claimed that Demetrias controlled Aetolia, Magnesia, and Thessaly and that as long as Demetrias, Chalkis, and Korinth were in Macedonian hands the Greeks could not consider themselves to be free (App. <hi rend="italic"> Mac</hi> . 8; Polyb. 18.11.4-7). Not surprisingly, therefore, Livy described Demetrias as an <hi rend="italic">urbem validam et ad omnia opportunam</hi> (39.23.12).<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Demetrias was also an important administrative center. Strabo mentions that it was a royal residence (<hi rend="italic">basileion</hi> ) for the Antigonids while Livy (35.31.9) refers to a <hi rend="italic">regia aedificata</hi> at Demetrias. This has been identified with the remains of a building that were discovered just north of the Sacred Market.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>
               </p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_112" n="112"/>
               <p>The royal residence was apparently built by Philip V and abandoned at the end of Macedonian rule in the area. In the fill of the building seals with the picture of a warrior on the prow of a ship have been found; one of the seals had the inscription <hi rend="Symbol">D</hi> HMHTPIE<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Epigraphic evidence from the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> attests the presence of a sanctuary of the <hi rend="italic">archegetai</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ktistai</hi> at Demetrias.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> In this sanctuary the heroes of the towns that were absorbed in the synoecism as well as the founder were honored. Plutarch says (<hi rend="italic">Demetr</hi> . 53) that Antigonos Gonatas buried his father in Demetrias; quite possibly his grave was at the site of the sanctuary. Demetrias is recorded in the Delphic <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list, which is dated to c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The evidence for the government of Demetrias dates mainly from the second half of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> and shows a fully developed polis structure.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> The earliest coins, hemidrachms with a prow on the reverse, are probably to be dated to c. 290 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the landward side Demetrias was surrounded by a wall approximately seven kilometers in circumference, much of which is still preserved. Located on the west side of the Pagasian Gulf, it was seven kilometers southwest of the modern Volos.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi>

According to Livy (36.11.7) Lysimacheia was on the road from Kalydon to Stratos. Polybius locates it near Konope, south of the lake of Lysimacheia (5.7.7). Finally, a file with the stamp <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00095.gif"/> has been discovered half an hour south of Dokimion on the north shore of the lake.

On the lake of Lysimacheia (the modern Lake of Angelokastron or Lisimakhia), which Strabo says (10.2.22) was formerly called Hydra, see Bölte, "Lysimacheia 2." Woodhouse's confusion (224-27) of this lake with its eastern neighbor, the modern Lake Agrinion, results from his locating Lysimacheia farther east at Papadates.

A. de Longpérier (<hi rend="italic">RN</hi> [1859] 111), however, assigned the Philippopolis coins to the like-named city in Thrace. The (partially restored) name "Gomphoi" appears in a Delphic inscription dated to between 217 and 207 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">FD</hi> III.3.221.6); also in Livy 32.14.1-2 (198 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), 36-13.6 (191 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), 38.2.11 (189 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), and 42.55.4 (171 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ); and in Euseb. <hi rend="italic">Chron</hi> .

                  <hi rend="italic">thessalischen Bundes</hi> , Demetrias II [Bonn, 1978] 37, 54). For Gomphoi in a Delphic inscription of 130/129 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> see <hi rend="italic">FD</hi> III.2.68.6.</p>
               <p>2. Tscherikower suggested it was Philip V who <hi rend="bold">renamed Philippopolis</hi> and that this is "in die Zeit des Krieges der Römer mit Antiochos III. oder gleich darauf anzusetzen" (4); he did not specify any further. Philip V had possession of Gomphoi only from 191 to 185 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Furthermore, Livy still refers to it as Gomphoi in describing the events of 189 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (38.2.11). Thus, if Philip V renamed Gomphoi and if the name in Livy 38.2.11 reflects its usage at the time, then Gomphoi will have been renamed after 189 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and will have reverted to its old name after 185 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Unfortunately, Tscherikower's case is weakened by the fact that he ignored the numismatic evidence.</p>
               <p>In contrast to Tscherikower, most historians and numismatists have assigned the founding of Philippopolis to the father of Alexander the Great; see, for example, B. Helly, <hi rend="italic">Gonnoi</hi> I: 82 and n. 2. There is no explicit literary or extant epigraphic evidence to support this claim. Nevertheless, recognizing the strategic importance of the town, scholars have assumed that Philip fortified and renamed it. The only supporting evidence for this hypothesis is the silver coinage with the legend <hi rend="Symbol">F</hi> I<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> I<hi rend="Symbol">PP</hi> O<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> O<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> IT<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N. On stylistic and historical grounds it is most likely to be dated to the time of Philip II; see E. Muret, 289; C. M. Kraay, <hi rend="italic">Archaic and Classical Greek Coins</hi> (Berkeley, 1976) 119; T. R. Martin, <hi rend="italic">Sovereignty and Coinage in Classical Greece</hi> (Princeton, 1985) 56 and n. 58. <hi rend="italic">Nota bene</hi> , however, Martin's caveat: "The chronology of the coins of Gomphi/Philippopolis is impossible to determine with any accuracy and so the possibility cannot absolutely be ruled out that its coinage was suppressed by Philip at the same time as the coinages of all other Thessalian cities except for Larissa." On the other hand, as Martin (54-56) and Kraay (op. cit. and <hi rend="italic">Greek Coins and History</hi> [London, 1969] 15-16) note, the suppression of Thessalian coinage by Philip after 344 was not as general as once believed (so, for example, P. Collart, <hi rend="italic"> Philippes</hi> [Paris, 1937] 164). Gardner's down-dating of these coins to the time of the Lamian War or of Demetrios Poliorketes (<hi rend="italic">BMC Thessaly</hi> , xxxv-xxxvi, followed by [Hammond and] Griffith, <hi rend="italic">Macedonia</hi> , 2: 540) is not likely. The old name appears again soon after 330 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> in an inscription from Argos (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> IV.617.10; see Stählin, 126; Westlake, <hi rend="italic">Thessaly in the Fourth Century</hi> [London, 1935] 178).</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the problem remains of the (re)appearance of the name Philippopolis in Livy's narrative of the events in 185 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Leake argued unconvincingly (<hi rend="italic">NG</hi> , 4: 364) that Livy meant Phthiotic Thebes, which was also renamed Philip-popolis, rather than Gomphoi. Stählin, on the other hand, suggested (<hi rend="italic">Hellen. Thessal</hi> ., 126 and n. 8) that the name Philippopolis was purposely inserted in the discussion at Tempe by the Macedonian delegates! In this Stählin, who also attributed the renaming to Philip II, apparently assumed that the name had been briefly used a century and a half before, been dormant since, and was then suddenly revived by the Macedonian embassy in 185 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ! In sum, despite the apparently anachronistic—and not easily explained—appearance of "Philippopolis"</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_118" n="118"/>
               <p>in Livy's account of the conference at Tempe, historical probability and the stylistic evidence of the coinage favor Philip II as founder. A final solution, however, must await further evidence.</p>

               <p>In 223 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Mantineia was captured by the Achaeans with the help of Antigonos Doson. The Achaeans massacred many of the male inhabitants; they enslaved others, as well as the women and children.<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> In addition, the wealth of the city was then divided between the Macedonians and the Achaeans on a two to one ratio. Subsequently, Plutarch tells us (<hi rend="italic">Arat</hi> . 45.6), Antigonos handed over the city to the Achaeans. They decided to colonize it and chose Aratos to be the founder (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00102.gif"/>). The new settlement was to be called Antigoneia, undoubtedly in honor of Doson. An inscription from Antigoneia (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> V.2.299), dated to the period between the capture of the city and the death of Doson in the spring of 220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , honors him as <hi rend="italic">soter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">euergetes</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The new name soon received general recognition and was used until the emperor Hadrian revived "Mantineia" (Paus. 8.8.12).<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> From an Antigoneian inscription that dates to before the Roman takeover in 146 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> V.2.263) we learn that the popular assembly was called <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00103.gif"/>; the <hi rend="italic">boule</hi> was termed, as in many Achaean cities, the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00104.gif"/>.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> The Achaean League coinage of Antigoneia is extensive.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> Antigoneia Mantineia was located fourteen kilometers north of the modern Tripolis, in eastern Arcadia.</p>

               <p>1. On the difficult question of the <hi rend="bold">chronology</hi> of this period see Walbank, <hi rend="italic">Aratos</hi> , 167-211, esp. 210; id., <hi rend="italic"> Comment</hi> ., 1: 257, 265, 274; Wall, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 1: 399. For the <hi rend="bold">atrocity at Mantineia</hi> see Plut. <hi rend="italic">Arat</hi> . 45; Polyb. 2.56.6, 58.4-15. At <hi rend="italic">Arat</hi> . 45.6 the manuscripts of Plutarch say that the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00105.gif"/> had received Mantineia from Antigonos. Curtius (<hi rend="italic">Peloponnesos</hi> , 1: 268) emended this to <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00106.gif"/>. This had been accepted by most scholars (e.g., Niese, <hi rend="italic">GMS</hi> , 2: 349 n. 3; Tscherikower, 6; Hiller von Gaertringen, 50; Bölte, 1329). Fougères, however, retained the manuscript reading and suggested that after Antigonos gave the city to the Argives they repopulated and annexed it (<hi rend="italic">Mantinée</hi> , 503-4; see also Droysen, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 3: 555). He also suggested it was only in 198 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when Philokles, the general of Philip V, removed Argos from Achaean control (Livy 32.25), that Antigoneia became an independent member of the Achaean League (508-9 and n. 4).</p>
               <p>2. Pausanias (8.8.11) says it was the Mantineians who decided to <hi rend="bold">rename the city</hi> ; Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">Arat</hi> . 45.6) relates that Aratos arranged for the decree to be passed. On Aratos' role as founder see Leschhorn, 324-26. For Antigoneia Mantineia see, for example, Ptol. 3.14.40; Stephanos s.v. "Antigoneia 2"; Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 4.20) listed the two as separate towns.</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_124" n="124"/>
               <p>3. The old <hi rend="bold">name</hi> , however, never fell totally out of favor: "Mantineia" continued to be used by some ancient authors, e.g., Polyb. 4.21.9; 11.11.2, 3, and 6; Strabo 8.8.2; Plut. <hi rend="italic"> Phil</hi> . 10; cf. the persistence of the name Kelainai after its being renamed APAMEIA. On inscriptions and coins "Antigoneia" is always found—with one possible exception (see below)—after the renaming. Thus it appears in a restored Milesian inscription of c. 184 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">I. Milet</hi> 148.19-20: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00107.gif"/>; on the date see R. M. Errington, <hi rend="italic">Chiron</hi> 19[1989] 279-88) as well as in other inscriptions of the first centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ; see, for example, <hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 441.198 (= <hi rend="italic">I. Strat</hi> . 508.56); <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> IV.1136.9, V.2.268.6; and other references cited in Bölte, 1291.

               <p>The possible exception to the use of the new name on inscriptions and coins after 222 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> is the Delphic <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list (Plassart, <hi rend="italic"> BCH</hi> 45 [1921] 13, col. II.113), where "Mantineia" is used. The dating of the list was long a matter of dispute. Plassart (38-44) placed it in the first quarter of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> His dating was accepted by L. Robert (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 70 [1946] 514-15; in <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 11-12 [1960] 168, however, Robert preferred to reserve judgment on the question of the date). G. Daux, however, claimed that columns I-III, i.e., the main part of the list, are datable to the period 235-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">REG</hi> 62 [1949] 23-27; <hi rend="italic"> BCH</hi> 81 [1957] 393-95; and <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 104 [1980] 121). Recent studies have demonstrated that the earlier dating proposed by Daux is almost certainly correct and that the main part of the <hi rend="italic"> theorodokoi</hi> list should be dated to c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (M. B. Hatzopoulos, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 115 [1991] 345-47; P. Gauthier, <hi rend="italic">Sardes</hi> II: 149-50; C. Habicht, in <hi rend="italic">Praestant Interna: Festschrift Ulrich Hausmann</hi> [Tübingen, 1982] 381). It is probable, therefore, that the list antedates the name change. Crosby and Grace, writing in 1936, (see below, note 5) followed the later dating and suggested that certain Achaean League coins (nos. 86-95) with a trident and the letter M (or the monogram <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00108.gif"/>)—probably referring to "Mantineia"—might belong to the period c. 195-190 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (p. 18).</p>

               <p>The fact that the town of Methana in the Argolid was refounded as an Arsinoe is known only from epigraphic and numismatic evidence. An inscription of</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_125" n="125"/>
               <p>Eirenaios from Thera mentions an Arsinoe in the Peloponnese (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> XII.3.466). The same Eirenaios also appears in a restored inscription from Methana (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> IV.854) from the time of Ptolemy VI Philometor (181-145 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ). The identification of Methana and Arsinoe is confirmed by two other inscriptions found at Epidauros that record <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> arbitration in a dispute between Epidauros and Arsinoe in the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> IV<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 72) and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> an agreement of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> between Troizen and Arsinoe (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> IV<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 76). Finally, the discovery of a bronze coin at Methana with the legend AP<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> I(NOE<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N) provides further evidence for the identification of it with Arsinoe.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a garrison of Ptolemaic soldiers stationed in the town. Pausanias mentions a temple of Isis at Methana (2.34.1); the cult may well have been introduced during the period of Ptolemaic control. It was probably in this same period that the walls of the city were rebuilt.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The city served as an important Ptolemaic harbor; the extensive references in the agreement between Arsinoe and Troizen to the docking facilities at Arsinoe make this quite clear. Strategically located on the peninsula extending out from the Argolid, Arsinoe was an important base for controlling naval traffic in the Saronic Gulf. It was near the present village of Megalochorio.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Neither the founder nor the date of the founding is known. Most likely the founder was Ptolemy II Philadelphos, acting through his admiral Patroklos, soon after the death of Queen Arsinoe II in 268 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Presumably the city name reverted to Methana after the departure of the Ptolemies, that is, at some point after the mid-second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>

               <p>In 303 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , according to Diodorus (20.102.2-4), Demetrios Poliorketes attacked Sikyon and succeeded in driving out the Ptolemaic garrison that controlled the city. He then transferred the population from the old city, which was in the plain near the harbor, to the acropolis, a more easily defended site approximately four kilometers inland.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The acropolis in fact consisted of two plateaus. The lower plateau, now parry occupied by the village of Vasiliko, became the site of the new city. The upper plateau was occupied by the king's own garrison. According to Diodorus, Demetrios helped the inhabitants to build their new homes and reestablished <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00113.gif"/> . In gratitude the citizens rendered him divine honors, renamed the city Demetrias, voted him sacrifices, festivals, annual games, and generally granted him the honors due a founder (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00114.gif"/>).<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> From Athenaeus (13.577c) quoting Polemon we learn that Lamia, the king's mistress, built a <hi rend="italic">stoa poikile</hi> . The Hellenistic remains on the lower plateau are extensive and include a theater, <hi rend="italic">bouleuterion</hi> , and gymnasium. Furthermore, the discovery of foundations of houses and larger buildings lying in straight lines and intersecting at right angles indicates that the new city was laid out on a grid pattern.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The refounded city apparently signed a commercial agreement with Stymphalos. From the inscription recording the agreement we also learn that the chief magistrates of Demetrias were called <hi rend="italic">stratagoi</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> While the mint at</p>

               </p>
               <p>Although the Sikyonians remained permanently at the new site, the new name did not, apparently, survive. A treaty between Sikyon and Athens that may date to 301 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and that refers to the "Sikyonians" (rather than "Demetrias") would provide evidence for the short life of the new name.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> At any rate there is no definite evidence for the name Demetrias in the subsequent Hellenistic or Roman periods of the city's history.

In discussing the reasons for the refoundation Skalet (81) emphasized the reduced numbers of the inhabitants in the old city; Wehrli (194), on the other hand, followed Diodorus' emphasis on the inherent strength of the new location (20.102.2-4). The new city is mentioned as such by Pausanias (2.7.1: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00117.gif"/>) and Hierokles (646.8: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00118.gif"/>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Antioch in the Propontis</head>
               <p>Among the islands of the Propontis Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.151) mentions one called Antioch, which was apparently off the coast of Bithynia. Presumably this is the same island as the one listed by the <hi rend="italic">Tabula Peutingeriana</hi> (IX.1), also in the Propontis, off Constantinople.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> There is no further information available regarding this Antioch. Its precise identification and location are unknown, as is the founder. In any event, a strategically located stronghold in the Propontis would have been useful for securing supply lines to Thrace or for keeping watch over the western Bithynian coast. If it was a Seleucid colony, the question remains as to when it might have been established. Two possible candidates emerge as the most likely founder: Antiochos I at the beginning of his reign, when the Seleucids were conducting naval operations in the Propontis against the Bithynians (Memnon, <hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 434 F9-10; Justin 25.1.1), or Antiochos II, when he was besieging the city of Kypsela in Thrace (Polyaenus 4.16) and attacking Byzantion (Memnon, <hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 434 F15). Of the two I incline toward the former as the founder of Antioch in the Propontis.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Tscherikower does not list this Antioch. On the <hi rend="italic">Tab. Peut</hi> . IX.1 see also Miller, <hi rend="italic">Itineraria Romana</hi> , 610, who mentions the Princes' Islands (southeast of Istanbul in the Sea of Marmara) or the former island (now peninsula) of Arktonnesos (Kapu Dag) as possible sites. It is interesting to note, incidentally, that one of the Princes' Islands, Burgaz, was called <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00124.gif"/> in the Byzantine period: Theophanes Continuatus, p. 398; ps.-Symeon Magister, pp. 642, 732; George Monachos, p. 891 (all in <hi rend="italic">CSHB</hi> XXXIII); an inscription from the island dated to 1063 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> (B. de Montfaucon, <hi rend="italic">Palaeographia Graeca</hi> [Paris, 1708] 52). The modern Greeks called it "Antigoni." See further Dörner, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Panormos 7"; J. Papadopoulos, <hi rend="italic">Byzantinisch-neugriechische Jahrbücher</hi> (1926/27) 81-88.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi rend="bold">most likely candidate as founder is Antiochos I</hi> . In the early years of his reign he was faced with challenges to his authority in various parts of his empire, including northwest Asia Minor. Very little is known of the events in this region (see, for example, Wilcken, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Antiochos I," 2452-53; Bevan, <hi rend="italic"> House of Seleucus</hi> , 1: 129-35; W. Otto, <hi rend="italic">ABAW</hi> 34 (1928) 17-21; Will, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 1: 109; and Habicht, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Zipoites 1," 453-54). Nevertheless it is clear that Antiochos, concerned with the threat posed by Antigonos Gonatas, the Northern League, and, in particular, Bithynia, conducted operations in the Propontis c. 278 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Hence it is conceivable that, in an effort to reinforce the Seleucid presence in the area, he founded an Antioch there.</p>
               <p>Another possible founder is Antiochos II. During his lifetime the Troad was still controlled by the Seleucids (see, for example, <hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 18-20) and was the home of a</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_132" n="132"/>
               <p>number of royal mints (for example at Lampsakos, Abydos, ALEXANDREIA Troas, ILION; also LYSIMACHEIA in Thrace; see Newell, <hi rend="italic">WSM</hi> , 319-51; Houghton, <hi rend="italic">CSE</hi> , 58-61). Polyaenus (4.16) says "Antiochos son of Antiochos" besieged Kypsela in Thrace; presumably this is Antiochos II. Furthermore Droysen suggested (<hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 3: 303-9) that the siege of Kypsela and the attack on Byzantion took place during the same expedition. When this expedition took place is not known. Wilcken (<hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Antiochos II," 2455) believed it happened at the beginning of Antiochos II's reign. Droysen (<hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 3:307 and n. 1) dated it to before 259 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ; see also Bouché-Leclercq (<hi rend="italic">Hist. Sel</hi> ., 77 and n. 1). Niese, <hi rend="italic">GMS</hi> , 2: 137-38, suggested it was around 255 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , while Beloch (<hi rend="italic">GG</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 4. 1: 672 n. 5) opted for "die letzten Jahre des Antiochos." An Antioch in the Propontis would have been well located to protect travel from the Troad to Byzantion.</p>
               <p>Other possible founders of Antioch are Seleukos I Nikator, Antiochos Hierax, and Antiochos III. After his victory over Lysimachos at Korupedion in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Seleukos was murdered by Ptolemy Keraunos at a spot near Lysimacheia in Thrace. However, it is unlikely that he would have had the opportunity between Korupedion and his death to found an Antioch in the Propontis.</p>
               <p>Antiochos Hierax died as a fugitive in Thrace around 226 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Polyb. 5.74.4 and Walbank's commentary; Euseb. <hi rend="italic">Chron</hi> . I, p. 253 [ed. Schoene]). There is evidence for extensive activity by mints in the Hellespont under Hierax (see, for example, Newell, <hi rend="italic">WSM</hi> , 321-58; Houghton, <hi rend="italic">CSE</hi> , 58-61; id., <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 23 [1978] 59-68). On the other hand, there is no extant evidence that indicates Hierax founded colonies anywhere in the regions under his control. Furthermore, as a fugitive he would hardly have had the opportunity to establish a settlement! Finally, Antiochos Hierax was also "the son of Antiochos," <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi> ., of Antiochos II. Nevertheless it is unlikely that Hierax would have been besieging or have captured (the MS readings for Polyaenus 4.16 differ between <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00125.gif"/> and <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00126.gif"/>) any city. The death of Hierax removed a Seleucid presence in the Hellespontine region until 196 and 195 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when Antiochos III refounded Lysimacheia and pacified nearby areas. He did not remain long in the region on either of his visits and probably had no occasion to found an Antioch in the Propontis.</p>

               <p>1. Briefly, the suggestions regarding <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00129.gif"/> in the Stephanos passage are as follows: Meineke in his edition of Stephanos retained <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00130.gif"/>; Berkel and Westermann emended it to <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00131.gif"/>; Svoronos (<hi rend="italic">Numismatique de la Crète ancienne</hi> , 29-30) first suggested <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00132.gif"/> (cf. Strabo 10.4.7) and located Arsinoe near the village of Mallia; later he suggested reading <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00133.gif"/> and hypothesized that Ptolemy IV Philopator refounded Lyktos (which had been destroyed by Knossos and its allies in 220-219 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ; Polyb. 4.53.3-54.3) not on its original site but on the sea coast (<hi rend="italic">Ta Nomismata tou Kratous ton Ptolernaion</hi> , 1: 308-9; for the mention of Lyttos by the Sea in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> see <hi rend="italic">I. Cret</hi> . I: 234, ll. 8-10, and pp. 33-34; cf. Le Rider, <hi rend="italic">Essays S. Robinson</hi> , 230 n. 7). Tscherikower suggested (7; see also Longega, 118) Arsinoe was a refounding of the old Lyktos (presumably by Ptolemy IV). R. C. Bosanquet (in a letter cited by H. Schrader, <hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 29 [1904] 111) thought that Lyttos by the Sea referred to Chersonesos, which Strabo describes as the port of Lyktos (10.4.14), and that Chersonesos was renamed Arsinoe for a time; contra, Guarducci, <hi rend="italic">I. Cret</hi> . I: 180; see also Le Rider, 230 n. 9. Guarducci placed Arsinoe in the territory of Lyktos, without specifying the precise location (<hi rend="italic">I. Cret</hi> . I: 180). Le Rider commented (<hi rend="italic">Monnaies crétoises</hi> , 242; see also G. Manganaro, <hi rend="italic">Studi Levi</hi> , 2:50) that if <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00134.gif"/> is the correct reading, then Arsinoe was probably a coastal town in the territory of Lyktos. It should be noted, however, that Hellenistic foundations were not normally placed in the territory of other cities. But, then, we do not know what kind of settlement this Arsinoe was, nor do we know if Stephanos' text is correct. For a full survey of opinions on the Stephanos passage see Svoronos, <hi rend="italic"> Numismlique</hi> , 29-30; Le Rider, <hi rend="italic">Essays S. Robinson</hi> , 230-31. For other Ptolemaic Arsinoes being harbor towns see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 11-12, (1960) 156-57; Le Rider, <hi rend="italic">Essays S. Robinson</hi> , 233 n. 7. The <hi rend="bold">site of Lyktos</hi> is close to the modern village of Xyda (see Le Rider, <hi rend="italic">Monnaies crétoises</hi> , 236 and map at end; Guarducci, <hi rend="italic">I. Cret</hi> . I: 179ff.).</p>
               <p>2. The identification of the <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> of Arsinoe (see above) remains open. Ptolemy II Philadelphos was, of course, very active in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean as a colonizer: practically all the foundations on Cyprus, the southern Asia Minor coast, and Keos and Methana can, with varying degrees of certainty, be ascribed to him. This raises the strong possibility that Philadelphos also colonized on Crete, as he undoubtedly did on Keos and at Methana during the Chremonidean War. However, for Crete we also have Strabo's comment that Ptolemy IV Philopator (who was married to Arsinoe III) began to rebuild the walls of Gortyna (10.4.11). Whether Philopator's interest in Crete extended to refounding cities we do not know. Certainly he would have had the opportunity to rebuild it after it was destroyed in 220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> However, in the absence of any positive evidence supporting a claim for Philopator it is appropriate</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_134" n="134"/>
               <p>to identify Philadelphos as the likely founder (see also Huss, <hi rend="italic">Aussen</hi> ., 156 and n. 141)</p>
               <p>3. In his study of the <hi rend="bold">coinage</hi> of Crete, Svoronos attributed four groups of bronzes to the Arsinoe there (<hi rend="italic">Numismatique</hi> , 30-32, nos. 1-14). None can definitely be assigned to Arsinoe Lyktou. Svoronos himself later reassigned nos. 1-4 to ARSINOE Methana (<hi rend="italic">JIAN</hi> 7 [1904] 397-400). More recently, Le Rider has grouped nos. 7-13 with ARSINOE Rhithymna (<hi rend="italic">Essays S. Robinson</hi> , 231ff.). Le Rider also claimed that the attribution of nos. 5-6 (obv.—head of Athena; rev.—horn of plenty and the legend AP<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> I) and 14 (obv.—head of Athena; rev.—AP, torch in a crown) to a Cretan city is doubtful (231).</p>
               <p>The only <hi rend="bold">epigraphic reference</hi> to a Cretan Arsinoe is <hi rend="italic"> I. Mag</hi> . 21 (= <hi rend="italic">GDI</hi> 5152). This is an inscription from Magnesia on the Maeander that lists eight cities in Crete, among which is an Arsinoc (l. 8). However, since the list is not in any discernible geographic order, it is not possible to know where this city should be located; see Le Rider, <hi rend="italic">Essays S. Robinson</hi> , 229.</p>

               <p>Stephanos twice (s.vv. "Arsinoe" and "Marion") mentions an Arsinoe that previously had been called Marion. From Diodorus we learn that Marion was destroyed in 312 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> by Ptolemy I and its population transferred to Paphos (19.79.4).

               <p>by the Ptolemies for shipbuilding (Strabo 14.6.2,5) and an important Ptolemaic shipbuilding center. Thus a Hellenistic amphora found in the area of Paphos bears the name of a shipbuilder (A. H. S. Megaw, <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 72 [1952] 115), and a statue base found at Old Paphos (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 39 = T. B. Mitford, <hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> 56 [1961] 9, no. 17) records the erection of a statue by "King Ptolemy" for [Pyr]goteles son of Zoes, a naval architect who built a <hi rend="italic"> triakonteres</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eikoseres</hi> (a "thirty" and a "twenty" galley). For an explanation of the terms see esp. L. Casson, <hi rend="italic"> Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient Worm</hi> (Princeton, 1971) 137-40; see also R.

On the importance of Paphos for the Ptolemaic naval program see W. A. Daszewski, <hi rend="italic">RDAC</hi> (1987) 171-75. The inscription is dated palaeographically to the second quarter of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and, hence, may be ascribed to Ptolemy Philadelphos. This identification finds strong support in Athenaeus 5.203d-e, who specifically refers to the fact that Philadelphos was the largest shipowner of his day and that, among other ships, he owned two <hi rend="italic">triakontereis</hi> and one <hi rend="italic"> eikoseres</hi> . At the same time it is well to recall that the Ptolemaic Arsinoes on Cyprus (and generally elsewhere) were harbors (see Robert, <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 11-12 [1960] 155f.). In fact Strabo specifies (14.6.3) that ARSINOE near Palaipaphos had an anchorage, and ARSINOE near Salamis a harbor. Finally, the large number of dedications to Arsinoe Philadelphos found on Cyprus indicates clearly her prominence there (Mitford, <hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> [1961] 7-9, nos. 12-14, and commentary).

For the <hi rend="italic">theoroi</hi> to have visited Amathous after Ledroi would have involved some minor retracing of steps. On the other hand, if the restoration of "Arsinoe" for l. 9 is accepted, we must ask, which one? Watkin ("The Development of Cities in Cyprus," 419-20) assumes it would have been ARSINOE Marion. This would have involved, as he admits, a major detour for the <hi rend="italic">theoroi</hi> . A demur would not have been necessary, however, if they had gone from Ledroi to Arsinoe near Salamis. Furthermore, as Watkin notes (419), the next recognized destination was Arados on the Syrian coast. Arsinoe near Salamis would have provided an appropriate departure point for the crossing.</p>

               <p>The identification of an Arsinoe on Keos is based solely on epigraphic evidence. Among the inscriptions from Magnesia on the Maeander published in 1900 was one dated to around 210 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> that mentioned the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00140.gif"/> among cities of the islands.<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> In 1906 P.

Furthermore, he reasoned that because of its excellent harbor, Koresia on the northwest coast was probably the town that was refounded as an Arsinoe.

Launey (<hi rend="italic">REA</hi> [1945] 39), Robert (<hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 11-12: 155), and Bagnall (142) suggest that the new name was bestowed during the Chremonidean War.</p>
               <p>4. Koresia is recorded in a partly restored line of the Delphic <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list (col. 1.38). Plassart (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> [1921] 5) read for col. I. 37-38 of the list: ..<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> ...O———/ <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00141.gif"/>. Daux originally suggested for these two lines <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00142.gif"/> / <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00143.gif"/> (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> [1957] 395). The appearance of both Koresia and Arsinoe on the inscription would, of course, have excluded the former from having been renamed as an Arsinoe. However, the reading is very uncertain. Subsequently L. Robert suggested the following for line 37: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00144.gif"/> (<hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 11-12:171, and <hi rend="italic">Essays Welles</hi> , 200 n. 155). Daux suggested <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00145.gif"/> but nevertheless continued to maintain the identification of Poiessa-Arsinoe (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 89 [1965] 660).</p>
               <p>The appearance of Koresia in the <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list is awkward. While the date of the list is not definitely known, the most probable reconstruction would place it in the period 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ; see the discussion and references in ANTIGONEIA Mantineia. How, then, are we to explain the appearance of "Arsinoe" in <hi rend="italic">I. Mag</hi> . 50, which is dated to c. 210 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ? Three possibilities have been proposed: (1) Arsinoe was the renamed Poiessa (G. Daux; see above and note 2 for compelling objections to this identification); (2) the Arsinoe in <hi rend="italic">I. Mag</hi> . 50 refers to another Arsinoe, possibly in Crete (L. G. Mendoni, <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00146.gif"/> I [Athens, 1988] 820 n. 5; note,</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_139" n="139"/>
               <p>however, as Cherry and Davis objected [11 n. 3], that of the sixteen identifiable names preserved in the list at the end of <hi rend="italic"> I. Mag</hi> . 50 "all are in the Aegean islands and none is Cretan"; there is force to this objection, but it is <hi rend="italic">ex silentio</hi> ; and, of course, as Cherry and Davis readily observed, Cretan Arsinoes <hi rend="italic">are</hi> known); (3) the <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list may have used the original name, Koresia, rather than the new, official name, Arsinoe (L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 11-12: 168). Robert correctly points out that the original, local toponyms often persisted after a renaming. For example, we have evidence of this at ANTIGONEIA Mantineia and at APAMEIA Kelainai. This last remains the most likely explanation for the situation at Keos.</p>

               <p>The evidence for the refounding of Rhithymna on the north coast of Crete as an Arsinoe is numismatic. G. Le Rider has demonstrated that a series of coins with a head of Athena on the obverse and on the reverse, two dolphins, and the legend AP<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> I, is similar in type (in one case also in die) to a series of Rhithymna.<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> As the name Rhithymna is attested epigraphically at the beginning of the Chremonidean War, also in 235 or 234 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> and 223/2 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , this leaves three time periods in which the town might have been renamed: in the 270s, c. 265-235, or after c. 220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> There is no firm evidence to indicate in which of the three periods this happened; undoubtedly the founder was either Ptolemy II Philadelphos or Ptolemy IV Philopator. Each of these kings, it will be recalled, was married to an Arsinoe. However, Philadelphos' energetic activity elsewhere in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean suggests that here too he may have founded this Arsinoe.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Despite the fact that it had an autonomous coinage, it is at Rhithymna that the largest concentration of Ptolemaic bronzes on Crete, mostly of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , has been found.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Like the other Ptolemaic Arsinoe foundations this one, too, was a harbor town.

In favor of Philopator is the fact that he was interested in Crete and that, among other things, he began building the walls of Gortyna (Strabo 10.4. 11). Huss (155) and Fauré (op. cit.) prefer Ptolemy II.</p>
               <p>4. The concentration of <hi rend="bold">Ptolemaic bronzes in and around Rhithymna</hi> : Bagnall suggests it resulted from the presence there of the garrison that was paid in Ptolemaic currency (<hi rend="italic">Ptol.

               <p>There exist two other ancient references to an Arsinoe in Crete: Stephanos s.v. "Arsinoe 9"; <hi rend="italic">I. Mag</hi> . 21 (= <hi rend="italic">GDI</hi> 5152). For "Arsinoe 9" Stephanos writes <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00147.gif"/>. There has been much discussion regarding <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00148.gif"/>. The most likely suggestion places Stephanos' Arsinoe in eastern Crete in the territory of Lyktos; see ARSINOE Lyktou. If this is so, then Stephanos cannot be referring to the refounded Rhithymna, and we must conclude that there were two Arsinoes on Crete (Tscherikower, of course, does not list Arsinoe Rhithymna). The second reference, <hi rend="italic">I. Mag</hi> . 21, is an inscription of Magnesia on the Maeander that records eight cities in Crete, among which is an Arsinoe (l. 8). As the list is not in geographical order, it is not possible to know where to locate this city (Le Rider, <hi rend="italic">Essays S. Robinson</hi> , 229; id., <hi rend="italic">Monnaies crétoises</hi> , 242).</p>

               <p>According to Appian (<hi rend="italic">Mith</hi> . 46-47), in 86 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Mithridates Eupator, through the agency of one of his generals, deported the inhabitants of the city of Chios.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Memnon tells us (<hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 434 F23) that Mithridates then distributed the land to Pontic settlers he brought in. Now Plutarch says (<hi rend="italic">Luc</hi> . 18) that one of the king's wives was a Chian woman named Berenike. Finally, in his list of cities named Berenike, Stephanos (s.v.) gives a fourth that he says was previously called Chios. From this we may conclude that the main city of the island was renamed Berenike in honor of one of Mithridates' wives. The new name is not attested in any extant numismatic or epigraphic sources, nor is it likely that it lasted for a long time. The Roman capture of the city in the following year will doubtless have ended the brief flirtation with the name.</p>

               <p>At some point after 311 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Antigonos Monophthalmos founded Antigoneia in the Troad on the site of the former Sigia (Strabo 13.1.33, 47, 52). The towns included in the synoecism were Kebren and Skepsis (Strabo 13.1.33) and probably Larisa, Kolonai, Hamaxitos, and Neandreia as well (Strabo 13.1.47, 52).<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Quite possibly the founding took place at about the same time as the establishment of the Federation of the Troad, whose center was the temple of Athena at Ilion.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> There is no extant numismatic evidence that can be definitely attributed to Antigoneia and only two inscriptions (one of which is restored) that may possibly refer to it.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the battle of Ipsos (301 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ) this area came under the control of Lysimachos, and the town name was changed to Alexandreia (Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.124). Strabo says (13.1.26, 47) that Alexandreia included, among other towns, Larisa, Kolonai, Chrysa, Hamaxitos, Kebren, and Neandreia; he adds (13.1.52) that Lysimachos allowed the Skepsians to leave the synoecism. Later, in the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> , probably under Antiochos I, Kebren probably gained its freedom and was renamed Antioch.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Even with the defection of Skepsis and Kebren the territory of Alexandreia was quite large; it included all the coastal region south of Ilion to Cape Lekton. Furthermore, the fact that it had the only real harbor on the west coast of the Troad enhanced the importance of Alexandreia. At the site of the city itself there is evidence for a circuit wall that, it has been estimated, enclosed an area of approximately one thousand acres.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> The earliest coins with the legend A<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> E<hi rend="Symbol">X</hi> are bronze pieces similar in type to—and in imitation of—those of Hamaxitos and Neandreia.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">In general</hi> see Leaf, <hi rend="italic">Strabo on the Troad</hi> , 141-44, 233-40; Tscherikower, 16; Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> 923; L.

               <p>1. The <hi rend="bold">towns included in the synoecism</hi> : Cook notes correctly that Strabo explicitly mentions only Kebren and Skepsis as being in the original synoecism of Antigoneia (<hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> 83 [1988 14 n. 23). Nevertheless he suggests that Strabo's discussion (13.1.33; also 47 and 52) implies that the other towns were also included in Antigoneia. Since Strabo explicitly lists Skepsis as one of the towns involved and since it was still independent in 311/0 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 5 = <hi rend="italic"> RC</hi> 1, the letter of Antigonos to Skepsis), Antigoneia could not have been founded before that date. Although there is no explicit supporting evidence, Robert suggests that Birytis was also included in the synoecism (<hi rend="italic">ENG</hi> , 31 and n. 1). Cook (356-57), on the basis of the evidence of bronze coins of Birytis, which were probably minted after the end of the fourth century, i.e., after the synoecism, rejects this view.</p>
               <p>2. For the possible connection between the establishment of the <hi rend="bold">Federation of the Troad</hi> and the founding of Antigoneia see, for example, A. Brückner, in W. Dörpfeld, <hi rend="italic">Troja und Ilion</hi> (Athens, 1902) 2: 577-79; Bellinger, <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 7 (1957) 46; id., <hi rend="italic">Troy: The Coins</hi> , 3; Robert, <hi rend="italic">MAT</hi> , 21 n. 2; Cook, 364 Cf., on the other hand, Droysen (<hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 1: 783-85) and Magie (<hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 66), who believe that Alexander began the Federation. On the Federation see ILION.</p>
               <p>3. For a rare bronze with the name "Alexander" that Bellinger suggests may be "the first product of the mint later to be Alexandria Troas" see <hi rend="italic">Troy: The Coins</hi> , 78 and n. 3. For the <hi rend="bold">epigraphic references to Antigoneia</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 348 (an Eretrian decree honoring three Mends of Demetrios Poliorketes = <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> XII.9.210, 1. 16: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00153.gif"/>) and <hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 337.16 (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00154.gif"/>; see also Holleaux, <hi rend="italic"> Ét</hi> ., 1: 36 n. 1). It is not clear to which Antigoneia <hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 348 refers. At least five Antigoneias come to mind: the four Hellespontine Antigoneias (the later ALEXANDREIA Troas, ANTIGONEIA in Mysia, ANTIGONEIA near Daskyleion, and Antigoneia in Bithynia, which Lysimachos later refounded as NIKAIA) and the later Antioch on the Orontes. Clearly one of the Hellespontine cities is most likely the one referred to in the Eretrian decree. Robert (<hi rend="italic">MAT</hi> , 68) suggested—on weak grounds—this was Antigoneia in the Troad: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> he noted that the name of one of the persons honored, Hippodamos, is also found at Ilion in 77 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">I. Ilion</hi> 77.2); <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> he restored the same name on a coin of Ilion (<hi rend="italic">Troy: The Coins</hi> , 26, no. T58; <hi rend="italic">nota bene</hi> that the dating of the coin is not secure: it may date</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_147" n="147"/>
               <p>either to the period 188-133 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> or to post 133 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ; see Bellinger's comment on p. 26); <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> he called attention to the fact that two or three Trojan heroes were called Hippodamos. On the other hand, Diodorus says (20.111.3) that in 302 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Demetrios was campaigning in the Hellespont and recovered a number of cities, among them Lampsakos and Parion. Demetrios' presence in this region raises the possibility that the Antigoneians honored by the Eretrians came from either Antigoneia in Mysia or near Daskyleion.</p>
               <p>4. On the question of <hi rend="bold">the status of Kebren in the third century</hi>
                  <hi rend="bold">B.C.</hi> see Cook, 338-44; Robert, <hi rend="italic">ENG</hi> , 16-23; and ANTIOCH Kebren. For the possibility that Larisa also withdrew from the synoecism see PTOLEMAIS Larisa. For the coinage of Skepsis after it left the synoecism see J. H. Kagan, <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 29 (1984) 11-24. From the mention of Larisa and Hamaxitos in the Delphic <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list, which was dated to the early second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (A. Plassart, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 45 [1921] 8, col. I.D, ll. 18-19) Robert suggested that at the time these two towns were independent of Alexandreia (<hi rend="italic">ENG</hi> , 34-35). Note, however, that the <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list is now dated to c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (for the dating see ANTIGONEIA Mantineia). Cook objects (221 n. 2) that Strabo, depending on Demetrius of Skepsis (first half of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), speaks of these towns (and, incidentally, of Kebren as well) as being in the synoecism of Alexandreia (13-1.47 and 52). Of course it is also possible that the towns had withdrawn from the synoecism at various times during the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and then, subsequently, had rejoined Alexandreia; see also ANTIOCH Kebren. I am not convinced by Cook's other objection that inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list means only that the towns were stopping places for the <hi rend="italic">theoroi</hi> , not necessarily that they were poleis. On the opposing tendencies of polis integration and disintegration in the Hellenistic world see Robert, <hi rend="italic">ENG</hi> , 35-36; Wehrli, 87.</p>
               <p>5. On the <hi rend="bold">territory</hi> of Alexandreia see Cook, 196-202. For a description of the site see Cook, 198-202; Leaf, 236-40 (plan made in 1786 on p. 237, photographs, pls. XIII and XIV A). For the <hi rend="bold">circuit wall</hi> see Leaf, 236. On the modern confusion of the wall at Ilion (as described by Strabo 13.1.26) and the one at Alexandreia, see ILION.</p>
               <p>6. For <hi rend="bold">coins of Alexandreia</hi> assigned to the period of Lysimachos' reign see, for example, <hi rend="italic">BMC Troas</hi> , 9, nos. 1-6; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (Cop) <hi rend="italic">Troas</hi> 65-67; Bellinger, <hi rend="italic">Troy: The Coins</hi> , 81, nos. A21-A24; on the similarity of these coins to coins of Hamaxitos and Neandreia see W. Wroth, in <hi rend="italic">BMC Troas</hi> , xiv; Bellinger, 81. A coin of Neandreia overstruck with A<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> E<hi rend="Symbol">X</hi> shows that coins of towns absorbed continued to circulate even after the name of the city had been changed from Antigoneia to Alexandreia (D. Sestini, <hi rend="italic">Descrizione delle medaglie antiche greche del museo Hedervariano</hi> II [Florence, 1828] 139, no. 2).

               <p>For <hi rend="bold">coins of Lysimachos' mint at Alexandreia</hi> see, for example, Bellinger, 79-80, nos. A2-A20; M. Thompson, in <hi rend="italic">Essays S. Robinson</hi> , 176-77. Under Seleukos I and Antiochos I Alexandreia struck coins with the name and type of Alexander</p>

               <p>(Bellinger, 82, nos. A25-27 = Price, <hi rend="italic">Alexander and Philip</hi> , 235, nos. 1588-90). The <hi rend="bold">Seleucids also maintained a royal mint</hi> at Alexandreia. The earliest Seleucid coins date from the reign of Antiochos II (Newell, <hi rend="italic">WSM</hi> , 332-46; Houghton, <hi rend="italic"> CSE</hi> , 58-59.</p>
               <p>7. <hi rend="bold">Alexandreia was also known as</hi>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00155.gif"/> (App. <hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 29). In describing the same operations between Antiochos III and the Romans in the 190s, Livy mentions three cities: Smyrna, Lampsakos, and Alexandreia Troas (35.42.2; at 37.35.2 he gives the cities in the same order and also adds Lysimacheia), while Appian (<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 29) refers to Smyrna, Lampsakos, and Alexandreia on the Granikos (Tscherikower, 16 n. 30; Tarn, <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> , 2:240). The parallel is clear.</p>
               <p>Tarn explains (<hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> , 2:240) that the phrase <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00156.gif"/> should be translated "of the Granikos" and means that after his victory there Alexander promised to build a city at the site of Alexandreia just as he later promised to rebuild ILION. This "promise," as Tarn himself admits, is unrecorded (240). Tarn's claim that Alexander founded Alexandreia Troas is based on a late tradition recorded only in Stephanos (s.v. "Alexandreia 2") and pseudo-Callisthenes; see for example, the Greek version (3.35), the Armenian (English translation by A. M. Wolohojian, <hi rend="italic">The Romance of Alexander the Great by Pseudo-Callisthenes</hi> [New York, 1969] P. 159, sec. 285), and the Hebrew (English translation by I.J. Kazis, <hi rend="italic">The Book of the Gests of Alexander of Macedon</hi> [Cambridge, 1962] p. 158, sec. 130), which was, in turn, based on a Latin translation of the tenth century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> , <hi rend="italic">Historia de Preliis</hi> , by the archpresbyter Leo of Naples. The Syriac version attributes "Alexandreia in the land of Gelenikos" to Alexander (English translation by E. A. W. Budge, <hi rend="italic">The History of Alexander the Great, Bring the Syriac Version of Pseudo-Callisthes</hi> [Cambridge, 1889] p. 142, 3.24). Tarn is quite right to bring the information in pseudo-Callisthenes to our attention. Nevertheless pseudo-Callisthenes' "Life of Alexander" <hi rend="italic">is</hi> late, even if it was based on an earlier version. Furthermore it is a historical romance, not history. Thus we are left with the information in Stephanos, which is not, in itself, a fully reliable source. Hence I do not find Tarn's claim convincing. Berve (<hi rend="italic">Das Alexanderreich</hi> [Munich, 1926]), incidentally, did not make use of these later lists, nor did he consider Alexandreia Troas to be a foundation of Alexander.</p>

               <p>The town of Kebren underwent a series of changes in the Hellenistic age. Antigonos included it in his new foundation of Antigoneia. After the battle of Ipsos Lysimachos took over control of this region and refounded Antigoneia as Alexandreia (Strabo 13.1.26,33). Later on, perhaps under Antiochos I, Kebren was probably refounded as an Antioch. The evidence for the refounding is numismatic.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>

               <p>the legend ANTIOXE<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N, prompted Imhoof-Blumer to suggest that Kebren was renamed Antioch. Furthermore, noting the appearance of the letters B and K on the obverse of some of these coins, Robert hypothesized that they referred to Birytis and Kebren.

Therefore he concluded that Kebren and Birytis were united in a <hi rend="italic">Sympoliteia</hi> or synoecism and together were included in the territory of the new Antioch.</p>
               <p>We do not know how long the name "Antioch" persisted. Undoubtedly it ceased with the withdrawal of the Seleucids, if not before.

               <p>The numismatic evidence and the epigraphic evidence of Assos that I have quoted suggest that Kebren gained its freedom from Alexandreia in the course of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and was—briefly—renamed Antioch. This is, at first glance, in conflict with the literary testimony of Strabo, who expressly states (13.1.33) that although Skepsis withdrew from the new city of Alexandreia Troas, Kebren did not (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00161.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00162.gif"/>). Furthermore Strabo, writing in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps"> A.D.</hi> (and using the research of Demetrius of Skepsis, who wrote in the early second century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ) describes Kebren as then being in the synoecism of Alexandreia (13.1.47).</p>
               <p>Cook, following Strabo's account and pointing to <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> the lack of archaeological evidence on the Çal Dag for a Hellenistic city, <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> the absence of any reference elsewhere in the Hellenistic world to an Antioch (Kebren) or its citizens or to an independent city of Kebren, and <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> the lack of any coins of the Antiochenes in the Troad doubted that Kebren was ever reestablished as a <hi rend="italic">city</hi> once it had been absorbed in Alexandreia Troas by Lysimachos (<hi rend="italic">The Troad</hi> , 338-44; <hi rend="italic"> ABSA</hi> 83 [1988] 17-19).

               <p>Strabo's statement (13.1.33) indicates that at the time Skepsis withdrew from the synoecism Kebren remained. This happened in the lifetime of Lysimachos (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00163.gif"/>). There is nothing in Strabo to exclude the possibility that at some later date—under Antiochos I—Kebren also withdrew (Robert, <hi rend="italic">ENG</hi> , 21). Strabo's further comment (13.1.47) that Kebren belonged to the synoecism of Alexandreia may simply mean that by the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Kebren had rejoined Alexandreia Troas. Finally, the absence of any reference elsewhere in the Hellenistic world to Antioch (Kebren) or Antiochenes is not extraordinary: the refounding of Rhithymna as an ARSINOE, for example, is known only from local, civic coinage; neither Arsinoe nor its citizens are mentioned elsewhere in the extant evidence. The absence of coins of the Antiochenes in the Troad is possibly bothersome, but it is "negative evidence," as Cook says (<hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> 83 [1988] 18-19).</p>

Journal</hi> 22 (1865) 53-57 (description of the site, including the remains of a circuit wall; according to Calvert, of seventy-one coins found at the site itself and the immediate vicinity, twenty-five were of Kebren); further on the location see Cook, 327-40, map on p. 273, and literature cited on p. 327 n. 2; for a photograph see Cook, pl. 59a.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi rend="bold">location of Antioch</hi> , Cook surmised "it was a settlement of exiles at a distance from their old home" (344). He noted the absence of Antioch coins from the Çal Dag and, in fact, from the Troad. The provenience of the Antioch coinage, it should be noted, is apparently not known (Cook, 338 n. % following Robert). Cook suggested that a dedication of Roman date from the vicinity of Kyzikos to Dionysos Kebrenios might "offer a clue" to the location of Antioch (344 n. 1); contra, L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 106 (1982) 322-23 n. 23, who suggested that Antioch may have been centered at Birytis rather than at Kebren. Note, however, that the location of Birytis is not secure: L. Robert has argued it was close to Kebren (<hi rend="italic">ENG</hi> , 25-30; <hi rend="italic">MAT</hi> , 108-9; cf. <hi rend="italic"> BCH</hi> 106 [1982] 323 n. 23).

               <p>According to Strabo (13.1.58), "the kings" increased the depleted population of Gargara by transferring colonists from Miletoupolis after they had devastated the latter city. Unfortunately Strabo does not specify who "the kings" were.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> It is reasonable to suppose, however, that he was referring in this instance to the Attalid royal house. In any event, Strabo says the result of the population transfer was to reduce the Gargarans to "semi-barbarians."

At 13.1.128, in talking about Dardanos, he says "the kings" often transplanted it to Abydos. And at 14.2.25 he says "the kings" made improvements at STRATONIKEIA in Caria.

He says "this confirms it was only brought down to the coast under Pergamene rule" (262). However, the epigram could apply just as easily to either site. And, according to Cook (259), pottery found at the two sites (assuming they are correctly identified) suggests a date in the second half of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> for the move. At the very least we must distinguish between the removal of the town to its new site and the transfer of the Miletoupolitan population.

A tribe named Alexandris, which still existed in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">I.

Ilion</hi> , p. 225), Jones hypothesized that the tribe Alexandris alluded to the Trojan Pads (Alexander) rather than to the Macedonian king. Support for this interpretation may be seen in the discovery in Theater A at Ilion of a marble block with the inscription <hi rend="Symbol">D</hi> HI<hi rend="Symbol">F</hi> O (C. B.

Other examples of tribal names in theaters can be seen at HIERAPOLIS in Phrygia and Stobi (J. Wiseman, <hi rend="italic">Stobi: A Guide to the Excavations</hi> [Belgrade, 1973] 71). On the other hand, the fact that Alexander the Great made so many benefactions to Ilion and the pride that cities took in finding a connection, real or imagined, with the Macedonian king raise the possibility that the tribe was named for him rather than for the Trojan hero.</p>

The inscription honoring Malousios (<hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 330 = <hi rend="italic">I. Ilion</hi> 1), which is the first notice of the Federation, is dated to c. 306/5 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> by the fact that in decree I (l. 9) Antigonos is referred to by name only, while in decree II (1. 24) he is simply called "the king."

               <p>The controversy over the <hi rend="bold">date of the Athena temple and its sculptural decoration</hi> is an old one. Strabo (13.1.26; cf.

However, doubts have been expressed about his reliability because of the possibility that he conflated information about Ilion and ALEXANDREIA Troas; on which see the latter. Schliemann, for example, followed Strabo and attributed the temple to Lysimachos (<hi rend="italic">Troja</hi> [Leipzig, 1884] 224). On the other hand, an architrave block from the temple that bears Augustus' (partly restored) title (<hi rend="italic">I.

               <p>5. Strabo does not indicate which towns were included in <hi rend="bold"> Lysimachos' synoecism</hi> .

Cook's conjecture includes Sigeion, Birytis, Gentinos, and, probably, Achilleion (364 and map on p. 365; Cook also speculates that Skamandreia was later "attached to Ilion in a sympolity"). Later, in 188 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , Rome added Rhoiteion and Gergis to Ilion (Livy 38.39.10). It is not clear whether Gergis (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 10.6 = <hi rend="italic">I. Ilion</hi> 33.23 = <hi rend="italic"> OGIS</hi> 221.23) did (so Dittenberger commenting on <hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 221 followed by Welles commenting on <hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 10) or did not (so Droysen, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 1: 782) belong to Ilion c. 274 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when Antiochos I gave some royal land to Aristodikides. <hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 10.6 says only that land from property adjacent to Gergis or Skepsis was to be made available to Aristodikides. The land given to him was then to be joined to Ilion or Skepsis. If Gergis did belong to Ilion</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Strabo's account of the new wall</hi> that was built by Lysimachos (13.1.26) is a major crux, for in the next section (13.1.27) he says that in the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Ilion was an unwalled village whose homes lacked tiled roofs. It is possible that many of the towns that had been included in Lysimachos' synoecism broke away not long after the founding. Nevertheless, Strabo's claim that Ilion reverted to an unwalled village is inconsistent with other evidence, both literary and archaeological: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Polybius (5.111.2), who says that the city resisted a siege by Gauls in 216 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> Livy (37.37.2), who describes how the Scipios encamped on open, flat ground under the walls of Ilion in 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , and <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> the archaeological evidence for a wall dating from the early Hellenistic period.</p>
               <p>For a succinct statement of the problem of the forty-stade wall and references see Magie, 923; Bellinger, <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 7 (1957) 44-48. Briefly, Grote, in his <hi rend="italic">History of Greece</hi> (London, 1888) 1: 297 n. 1, objected that Strabo was inconsistent; at 13.1.26 he says Lysimachus provided Ilion with a forty-stade wall, but at 13.1.27, following Hegesianax and Demetrius of Skepsis, he describes it as "unwalled" at the time of the Galatian invasion of 278 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , and as a <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00168.gif"/> in 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Grote therefore suggested that at 13.1.26 Strabo "really meant to speak only of the improvements brought about by Lysimachus in <hi rend="italic">Alexandreia Troas</hi> ; that he never meant to ascribe to Lysimachus any improvements in <hi rend="italic"> Ilium</hi> ," and accordingly he emended the text of Strabo. In support of Grote, Dörpfeld (207) pointed out that Hellenistic Ilion was not big enough to have occupied an area surrounded by a forty-stade wall. Finally, Leaf pointed out (142-44) that "there was no trace whatever of any great wall at Ilium" but that Alexandreia Troas had a wall of forty stades. Thus he also followed Grote's suggestion and, in support of this, provided his own textual emendation. Contra, Brückner, 582; Tscherikower, 17-18; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">ENG</hi> , 7-8; see also R. Merkelbach, <hi rend="italic"> ZPE</hi> 23 (1976) 241-42. Now in addition to the philological arguments against the proposed emendations (noted by L. Robert, <hi rend="italic"> ENG</hi> , 7 and n. 4), the discovery by Blegen of a Hellenistic wall at Ilion—even if it was less than forty stades (<hi rend="italic">AJA</hi> 39 [1935] 26, 564; 41 [1937] 594)—suggests that Lysimachos did in fact build a wall at Ilion.</p>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Ptolemais Larisa</head>
               <p>In his book on the Troad published in 1973, J. M. Cook mentioned the discovery at Liman Tepe—the likely site of the ancient Larisa—of a coin that had the head of Apollo on the obverse and on the reverse, an amphora or crater with a bird on the groundline and the legend [<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> T]O<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> E[MAIE<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N].<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Cook noted that other coins of this type are known and, though ascribed to PTOLEMAIS Lebedos, still seemed to be "homeless." He further remarked on the similarity of the coin to those of Larisa in the Troad but commented that "it would be a bold man who would claim this coin as evidence of a third-century refoundation of Larisa under the Ptolemies."</p>
               <p>L. Robert has since made the claim that Larisa was renamed Ptolemais for a time. He based this conclusion on the similarity of coin types and the find location at Liman Tepe. Furthermore he argued that coins with the ethnic <hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> TO<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> EMAIE<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N or <hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> TO<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> E and an amphora but without a magistrate's name, previously grouped with other Ptolemais foundations, should be classed with Ptolemais Larisa.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ptolemies probably first gained control of the Hellespont during the Third Syrian War (246-141 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ).<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> In the Delphic <hi rend="italic"> theorodokoi</hi> list, now dated to c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , the name Larisa appears.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Furthermore, by the time of Ptolemy IV Philopator most of the Troad had slipped from Ptolemaic control. Hence, if Larisa was renamed Ptolemais, it would presumably have been for a short period in the decade after the Third Syrian War. The founder, therefore, would have been Ptolemy III Euergetes I.</p>
               <p>Larisa was a port on the coast of the Troad, south of Alexandreia Troas.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>

These coins have been assigned to various cities, among them PTOLEMAIS Lebedos, PTOLEMAIS in Pamphylia, and PTOLEMAIS in Carla. For the attribution of these coins to Larisa in the Troad see L. and J. Robert, <hi rend="italic"> JS</hi> (1976) 175 n. 87; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 106 (1982) 319-31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Larisa</hi> had been included in ALEXANDREIA Troas, which was founded by Lysimachos (Strabo 13.1.47). Hence the founding of Ptolemais would have entailed the withdrawal of Larisa from the synoecism. Presumably Larisa was later reabsorbed in Alexandreia: Strabo, writing in the early part of the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> but relying on Demetrius of Skepsis, who lived in the first half of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , described Larisa as being in the synoecism of Alexandreia (13.1.47).</p>
               <p>2. Cook objected to the Roberts' claim that Larisa was refounded as a Ptolemais (see articles cited above, "In general") on two grounds: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> in the Delphic <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list Larisa is listed under its old name, whereas Lebedos is still listed as PTOLEMAIS, and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> Larisa lies between ALEXANDREIA Troas and Hamaxitos, and "it is generally agreed that Hamaxitos was incorporated from the beginning in the synoecism" (<hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> 83 [1988] 15). To the first point we may reply that the fact that Lebedos in Ionia is listed as "Ptolemais" does not necessarily reflect on the situation in the Troad. It is possible that at the time of the <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list, now dated to c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (see below, note 4), Larisa had slipped away from Ptolemaic control; on the duration of Ptolemaic control in the Troad see below, note 3. Regarding the second point, the situation created by an independent Ptolemais interposing itself between Alexandreia and Hamaxitos (assuming Hamaxitos is correctly located; see Cook, <hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> 83 [1988] 15) is awkward but not unexampled: the Polish corridor separating Germany and East Prussia after World War I immediately comes to mind.</p>
               <p>3. In the Adoulis inscription (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 54.14-15) Ptolemy III claimed the <hi rend="bold">Hellespont</hi> as one of the areas he conquered during the Third Syrian War. Huss is of the opinion that by the time of Ptolemy IV Philopator the Ptolemies no longer controlled any city in the Troad (<hi rend="italic">Aussen</hi> ., 209). However, Polybius (5-34.7) indicates that under Philopator the Ptolemies still held the most important cities, places, and harbors "all along the coast from Pamphylia to the Hellespont and the places around Lysimacheia." What the Ptolemies actually controlled in the Hellespont at this time is not dear. In any event it did not include Lampsakos, Alexandreia Troas, and Ilion; these three cities had in 217 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> already been friendly with Attalos I for some time and remained so afterward (Polyb. 5.78.6).

Gaebler, <hi rend="italic">ZfN</hi> 34 (1924) 310 Robert (<hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> [1959] 175-78) denied the attribution of the coins to the Thracian Agathopolis for the following reasons: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> if Agathopolis was a Thracian coastal town in antiquity, it is incomprehensible that no evidence is extant for it in any of the ancient geographers or explorers—an <hi rend="italic">argumentum ex silentio</hi> , as Robert admits; <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> the coin types (obv.: young male with fillet, rev.: owl or double owl, laurel or caduceus, with the legend A<hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> A, etc.) are unique for cities of the Thracian Chersonese or the coast of Bulgaria; <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> the coins published by Borrell come from two different collections from Smyrna; and <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> no Agathopolis coins have been found in Bulgarian collections.</p>
               <p>In support of his removal of the Agathopolis coins to Mysia, L. Robert referred to the article published by Gaebler (op. cit.) in 1924. There Gaebler mentioned a coin with the head of a young man bound with a fillet—stylistically the same as that of the Agathopolis coinage—on the obverse and on the reverse, the <hi rend="italic"> protome</hi> of a winged horse and the legend A<hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> A<hi rend="Symbol">Q</hi> (previously this had been read as <hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> IN). Gaebler pointed out that the reverse type was also to be seen on coins of Lampsakos in Mysia. As a result this particular coin had previously been classed with Linos, a Mysian coastal town near Lampsakos. Robert, however, seized on the new reading of the legend and used this as the basis for transferring the Agath(opolis) coins to Mysia. He also pointed out that the double owl on the reverse that is found on coins of Agath(opolis) is also the most frequently used reverse type on coins of Miletoupolis in Mysia; see J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BE</hi> (1960) 236 and (1969)</p>

               <p>1. In 1949 L. Robert suggested there was another Antioch in northwest Asia Minor in addition to Antioch Kebren (<hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 7:211 n. 3). Two years later he suggested (<hi rend="italic">ENG</hi> , 23-24) that some coins with a diademed head on the obverse and a double owl with the legend ANTIOXE<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N on the reverse, previously attributed by Heichelheim to ANTIOCH Kebren (<hi rend="italic">Hesperia</hi> 13 [1944] 361-63), might be attributed to Miletoupolis in Mysia. The latter had as its most frequent reverse type the double owl. Thus Robert tentatively presented the hypothesis that it was Miletoupolis that had been refounded as an Antioch. Furthermore the coinage of his hypothetical AGATHOKLEIA in Mysia also had as one of its main reverse types an owl or double owl. L. Robert noticed this similarity and described Miletoupolis as "qui fur sans doute un temps une Antiocheia et peut-être auparavant une Agathocleia" (<hi rend="italic">ATAM</hi> , 89 n. 572; J. and L.

               <p>Strabo says (13.1.70) "near the source [of the Kaikos River] is a village, Gergitha, to which Attalos transferred the people from the Troad when he destroyed their place (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00172.gif"/>)." This is our sole piece of substantive evidence for the colony called Gergitha. We do not know for certain who the founder was, the identity of the <hi rend="italic">chorion</hi> whence the settlers came,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> or the location of the new colony.

Two possibilities have been suggested for <hi rend="bold">the place whence the colonists carne</hi> : Gergithion in the territory of Lampsakos (Strabo 13.1.19) and Gergis near Ilion. The problem of identifying Gergis and indicating its relation to Gergithion is compounded by (1) Strabo's failure to indicate at 13.1.70 which <hi rend="italic">chorion</hi> Attalos destroyed in order to found the new Gergitha, (2) his confusion in the account of Gergithion in the Troad (13.1.19), and (3) his omission of any reference to Gergis in the Troad (for Gergis and Gergithion see, for example, Stephanos s.v. "Gergis"; Xen. <hi rend="italic">Hell</hi> . 3.1.21-22; Livy 38.39.10; <hi rend="italic">NH</hi>

In fact one should recall that Gerg- toponyms are quite widespread in western Asia Minor. Hence the name Gergitha may not necessarily derive from Gergithion or Gergis.</p>
               <p>2. For the <hi rend="bold">founding of the colony</hi> by Attalos I after 218 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> see Hansen, 175. Tscherikower (19) and Radet (<hi rend="italic">La Lydie</hi> , 306) suggest that the same monarch established the colony after his victory over the Gauls in the area of the sources of the Kaikos c. 238/7 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (for the date see Allen, <hi rend="italic">Attalid Kingdom</hi> , 198). But as Hansen points out (42 n. 83) Attalos had no relations with the Troad at this early time. Niese (<hi rend="italic">GMS</hi> , 3:64 n. 3) believed the founder was Attalos II. Magie's passing suggestion (742) that at 13.1.19 "Attalos" may be a mistake for "Antiochos" is unlikely.</p>
               <p>3. For the <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of the new Gergitha, Radet suggests Ghelembeh (<hi rend="italic">La Lydie</hi> , 306); Philippson (<hi rend="italic">Reisen</hi> , 1: 67-68) and von Diest (<hi rend="italic">Von Perg</hi> ., 17) hypothesize it was Gertze (Yirce) which could be a survival of the ancient name.</p>
               <p>At the village of Yirce a fragmentary Hellenistic honorific inscription has been found (H. Taeuber, <hi rend="italic">AST</hi> 7 [1989] 219; see also Cl. Brixhe and A.

This is all that is known about Lysimacheia. The location of Kanai and Atarnea on the Aeolic coast opposite the southern part of Lesbos suggests that Lysimacheia was likewise in this region.

In an apparent attempt to locate Lysimacheia, Tscherikower (20 n. 53) calls attention to the fact that in the section preceding the one under discussion (i.e., <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.121) Pliny mentions an Attaleia among a number of Aeolian cities inland from Kyme and Myrina. However, this is based on a variant reading. As Tscherikower admits, the more likely reading is "Itale"; see the Teubner text (ed. C. Mayhoff [1906; reprint, Stuttgart, 1967]). Schuchhardt (<hi rend="italic">Alt. v. Perg</hi> . 1: 118) tentatively suggested that Lysimacheia was on the Kanai Peninsula, possibly at the modern Hatiplar.</p>

Kleiner dated the Alexanders between 202/1 and 189/8 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ; Boehringer, followed by Mørkholm, dated the beginning of the coinage to c. 220-210 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> The latter dating is preferable.</p>
               <p>8. The minting of coins with the portrait of Philetairos probably continued at least into the 180s <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> and overlapped with the earliest cistophori; see, for example, G. Le Rider, <hi rend="italic">JS</hi> (1989) 169-72; R. Bauslaugh, <hi rend="italic"> NC</hi> (1990) 60-61; H. Nicolet-Pierre, in <hi rend="italic">KME</hi> , 209-12 (the latter suggests that the minting of coins with the Philetairos portrait continued to the 150s).

               <p>I should mention here a fragmentary inscription of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> found at Pergamon, which deals with the affairs of an Attalid military colony that was apparently near the capital (<hi rend="italic">I. Perg</hi> . 158 = <hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 51; see also <hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 16). Very briefly, the inscription mentions different size allotments; it distinguishes between vine and cleared land and records the tax rate for each type. The document indicates that some plots of land were sold outright to the settlers and that childless colonists could bequeath their allotments upon payment of the inheritance taxes. The inscription also deals with the maintenance of the temples and the gymnasium. On this important document see Welles, <hi rend="italic">AJA</hi> 42 (1938) 248 (on cleared land) and his commentary on <hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 51; Hansen, <hi rend="italic"> Attalids</hi>

               <p>B. Virgilio has argued that there was a military colony at Pergamon (<hi rend="italic">Studi ellenistici</hi> 1 [1984] 34-36). He points to Strabo 13.4.2, who, in discussing the achievements of Eumenes II, remarks: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00176.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00177.gif"/>. Virgilio claimed that the use of the term <hi rend="italic">katoikia</hi> along with the evidence of <hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 51 and <hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 338 provides information for the existence of a military colony at Pergamon. However, in Strabo the term <hi rend="italic">katoikia</hi> is used generally to describe a settlement or town. It is not used specifically to refer to a military colony (see, in general, L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 109 [1985] 481-84; cf. id., <hi rend="italic">Ét. anat</hi> ., 191-94).</p>

               <p>2. Magie suggests the <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of Philetaireia was on the eastern side of the Ida range, since the western side was probably under the control of Skepsis at the time (<hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 734); Allen (<hi rend="italic">Attalid Kingdom</hi> , 23) places it "somewhat north of the Adramyttene Gulf, in the south-east of the Troad"; see also Virgilio, 113 (between Antandros and Adramyttion), who emphasizes its strategic importance in controlling access from the Troad to Mysia.</p>
               <p>3. For the suggestion that Philetairos was the <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> of Philetaireia by Ida see Allen, <hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> 66 (1971) 3; id., <hi rend="italic"> Attalid Kingdom</hi> , 24 (followed by Schalles, <hi rend="italic"> Untersuchungen</hi> , 32). Briefly, Allen argues as follows: Eumenes I ascended the throne in 263 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Since his agreement with the mercenaries at Philetaireia and Attaleia used Seleucid dating, it had to have been written before the battle of Sardis; this battle must date to the period between 263 and 261 (Antiochos I's death). Hence Allen concludes that these two settlements were begun before Eumenes' accession. This conclusion does not, however, necessarily follow. It will be recalled that Philetairos followed a general policy of avoiding conflict with the Seleucids. One wonders if the establishment of a military colony would not have been considered provocative by the Seleucids. Eumenes I followed a much more aggressive policy vis-à-vis the Seleucids. It is quite possible, therefore, that Eumenes founded Philetaireia and Attaleia as well very early in his reign, i.e., in the period between his accession and the battle of Sardis. For Eumenes I as the possible founder see, for example, Tscherikower, 18; Hoffmann, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Philetairos," 2161; Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 22; and below.</p>
               <p>The town name Philetaireia is found three times in <hi rend="italic">I. Perg</hi> . 13. Once the town is called simply Philetaireia (l. 2) and twice it has the qualifying <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00178.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00179.gif"/> (ll. 20, 55). The name Philetaireia (without "by Ida") is also found in two other Attalid inscriptions. The first, a dedication made by Diogenes the son of Epikles, mentions a Eumeneion (<hi rend="italic">I. Perg</hi> . 240 = <hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 336). <hi rend="bold">A problem arises regarding the relationship of the Philetaireia mentioned in the</hi>

Hence they have seen the existence of a Eumeneion as proof that Eumenes was considered the founder (<hi rend="italic">ktistes</hi> ) of Philetaireia by Ida (see, for example, Fräankel's commentary on <hi rend="italic">I. Perg</hi> . 13.2; G. Cardinali, <hi rend="italic">Il regno di Pergamo</hi> [Rome, 1906] 14-15; Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 97-99; Tscherikower, 18).</p>
               <p>However, another Pergamene inscription (<hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> IV.292 = H. Hepding, <hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 32 [1907] 245-47; see the commentary on pp. 254-55) records a decree passed in 69 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> or before (on the date see the important discussion of C. P. Jones, <hi rend="italic">Chiron</hi> 4 [1974] 183-205; see also J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1974] 466) honoring the gymnasiarch Diodoros Pasparos. It mentions a procession (11. 40-43) that was to go from Pergamon to Diodoros' <hi rend="italic">temenos</hi> , the Diodoreion, in Philetaireia on the dedication day. Clearly <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Philetaireia was either in or very close to Pergamon and must be distinguished from Philetaireia by Ida, which was more than a day's march away (L. Robert, REA [1934] 524; Boehringer and Krauss, <hi rend="italic"> Alt. v. Perg</hi> . IX: 89-90; Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>

Since the Eumeneion mentioned in the Diogenes inscription could have been located in Philetaireia near or in Pergamon rather than in Philetaireia by Ida, its existence cannot serve as evidence for positing the <hi rend="italic">ktistes</hi> of the latter town. Schalles, in fact, suggested that the Eumeneion was a <hi rend="italic">temenos</hi> for a posthumous cult of the deified Eumenes II (<hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen</hi> , 32). On the administrative relationship of the Philetaireia of the Diodoros inscription with Pergamon see Allen, <hi rend="italic">Attalid Kingdom</hi> , 23 n. 49; Virgilio, 112.</p>

               <p>In his enumeration of towns and peoples in Mysia Pliny mentions the "Poemaneni Macedones Asculacae" (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.123). Based on Pliny, one could assign the "Macedones" either to "Poemaneni" or to "Asculacae." Most scholars punctuate without comment between Poemaneni and Macedones Asculacae. However, Radet and Tscherikower have called attention to two entries in Stephanos, "Poimanenon" and "Poimen."<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Under the second, Stephanos mentions a mountain, Poimenion, in Macedonia.

               <p>Around 294 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> control of Ephesos passed from Demetrios Poliorketes to Lysimachos.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> It appears that shortly after this Lysirnachos renamed it Arsinoe after his wife and began building a new city.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> As the old site no longer provided access to the sea (due to the silting of the Kayster River), Lysimachos rebuilt the city at a new location to the southeast, in the area between the Bülbüldag and the Panayirdag. He also built a wall of over nine kilometers to enclose the city<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> and—probably at the same time—reconstituted the <hi rend="italic">gerousia</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> The Ephesians were reluctant to move (Strabo 14.1.21) probably because the new site was located in an area that included archaic graves. Nevertheless Lysimachos was able, by a ruse, to move the inhabitants;<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> in addition he brought other settlers from Kolophon and Lebedos. It was also at this time, apparently, that the coastal town of Phygela was incorporated into Ephesos.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> In 104 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> , Gaius Vibius Salutaris dedicated a series of statues at Ephesos, including one of Lysimachos. All the other statues were of divinities. This suggests that Lysimachos was considered the hero-founder of the city and that there was probably a cult devoted to him during his lifetime.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a royal mint at Arsinoe that produced some staters and tetradrachms, but mainly drachms.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi> The city name occurs as "Arsinoe" in the literary and occasionally as "Arsinoeia" in the epigraphic evidence; on local coins it is usually abbreviated AP<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> I.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> The importance of the city is emphasized by the discovery there of the remains of a monumental statue of Lysimachos.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi> Arsinoe was residing in the city in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> . (Polyaenus 8.57). The city name "Arsinoe" lasted only until 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when Lysimachos was defeated by Seleukos Nikator at Korupedion. Thereafter Ephesos alternated between Seleucid and Ptolemaic control until, in 188 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , it came into Attalid hands.<hi rend="superscript">11</hi> The remains of Ephesos are adjacent to the modern town of Selçuk.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Demetr</hi> . 35.3), while Demetrios was campaigning in Laconia he learned that Lysimachos had taken "his Asian cities." Lysimachos left Asia shortly thereafter, because from 294 to 289 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> he was in Thrace (Geyer, <hi rend="italic"> RE</hi> s.v. "Lysimachos 1," 12). Furthermore the city already had the name "Arsinoeia" by 289 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Milet</hi> 1.2.10.24 = <hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 368.I, the Milesian copy of a decree of the Ionian Koinon in honor of Hippostratos, dated 289/8 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ).

               <p>2. Both Strabo (14.1.21) and Stephanos (s.v. "Ephesos") say that <hi rend="bold">Lysimachos named the new city in honor of his wife</hi> (see also Polyaenus 8.57).

               <p>4. Strabo ascribes four undertakings to Lysimachos: renaming the city, rebuilding the walls, moving the population, and reconstituting the <hi rend="italic">gerousia</hi> (14.1.21; on the question of the nature of the reconstituting, see Oliver, 13-18). <hi rend="bold">When the</hi>

                  <hi rend="bold">was reorganized is not clear</hi> . One would assume from Strabo's narrative that all the changes happened at around the same time, and I have shown above that this was probably c. 294 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> On the other hand, an Ephesian inscription (Oliver, no. 1 = <hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 353 = <hi rend="italic">I. Ephesos</hi> 1449) conferring citizenship on Euphronios (on which see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic"> RPh</hi> [1967] 15-16 n. 5) mentions an embassy sent by the <hi rend="italic"> gerousia</hi> to Prepelaos (for the <hi rend="italic">gerousia</hi> in another, fragmentary inscription see <hi rend="italic">GIBM</hi> , 3: 470). The latter, a general of Kassandros, captured Ephesos in 302 and held it until Demetrios retook the city the following year (Diod. 20.107 and 111). The question is whether the inscription dates to that period, when we know Prepelaos was at Ephesos (so D. van Berchem, <hi rend="italic">MH</hi> 37 [1980] 25-27), or to the period around 294 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when, presumably, Prepelaos could have returned following the second capture of the city by Lysimachos (see further, Oliver, 18-20). Habicht notes that the Hellenistic evidence for the <hi rend="italic">gerousia is</hi> confined to the early</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_179" n="179"/>
               <p>third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Pointing out that we again encounter the <hi rend="italic">gerousia</hi> for the first time in 104 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> —which is when we find Salutaris dedicating a statue of Lysimachos— he suggests that the reintroduction of the <hi rend="italic">gerousia</hi> and the founder cult may have occurred together (<hi rend="italic">Gott</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 40-41).

Strabo says (14.1.21) that in order to force the Ephesians to abandon their old site Lysimachos waited for a heavy rain and then blocked up the drainage channels; the subsequent flooding made the people happy to leave. (Stephanos s.v. "Ephesos" mentions the destruction caused by flooding but indicates it was a natural disaster. He also quotes an epigram [<hi rend="italic">Anth. Pal</hi> . 9.424] of Duris of Elaia that describes it as a natural disaster; see Reitzenstein, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Duris 2").</p>

               <p>The new site was strategically a better location (Alzinger, <hi rend="italic"> RE</hi> Suppl. XII: 1596).

Robert, <hi rend="italic">Claros</hi> , 80-81), who dates the incorporation to the beginning of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when Ephesos was refounded; contra, Knibbe, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> Suppl.

               <p>I might mention <hi rend="bold">the mausoleum at Belevi</hi> , 16 km northeast of Ephesos. It is not securely dated and probably underwent a number of building phases.

               <p>After its destruction by Alyattes in the latter part of the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Smyrna was reduced, in the words of Strabo (14.1.37), to a "village-like" existence. Local tradition—as reflected in Pausanias, Pliny, Aelius Aristides, and the numismatic evidence—looked upon Alexander the Great as the founder of the new city of Smyrna.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> What he did, if anything, is not clear. On the other hand, Strabo, writing a century or more earlier than any of the above authors, omitted mention of Alexander; rather, he said that Antigonos Monophthalmos reassembled (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00189.gif"/>) the village community, and after him Lysimachos did likewise (14.1.37).<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> From this we may conclude that Antigonos initiated the synoecism that produced the new Smyrna and that Lysimachos continued it.</p>
               <p>The evidence for the name "Eurydikeia" is wholly numismatic;<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> the name is nowhere found in the literary or extant epigraphic evidence. Nevertheless it is clear that Lysimachos was naming Smyrna for his daughter, Eurydike, just as he renamed Ephesos "Arsinoe" for his wife. We do not know when the name was first used; at any rate it probably was dropped after 287 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , the year in which Eurydike was imprisoned by her father (Justin 16.2.4).

               <p>1. Although Strabo's claim that Smyrna existed "village-like" after its capture by the Lydians is essentially correct, the figure of four hundred years that he gives as the time span for this is too long; see Cook, 31 and n. 85. <hi rend="bold">For Alexander as founder</hi> of Smyrna see Paus. 7.5.1; Aelius Aristides 20.7, 20, and 21.4 (ed. Keil); and Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.118. Pausanias (7.5.2-3) tells the delightful story of Alexander falling asleep under a plane tree and of Nemeses appearing to him and telling him to refound the city. He also adds that the Smyrnaians thereupon sought the advice of Apollo at Klaros who answered: "Three times blest and four times will those be who will inhabit Pagos beyond the sacred Meles." H. W. Pleket recognized the words "sacred Meles" in a fragmentary inscription that probably dated to the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> and that was said to come from Smyrna (<hi rend="italic">The Greek Inscriptions in the "Rijksmuseum van Oudheden" at Leyden</hi> [Leiden, 1958] 75-76, no. 62 = <hi rend="italic">I. Smyrna</hi> 647). J. M. Cook subsequently noticed that the first line of the fragment probably described the next two lines as an oracle and that the text of the oracle was to be restored in the next two lines (<hi rend="italic">CR</hi> 75 [1961] 7-8; see also C. Habicht, <hi rend="italic">Cl. Ant</hi> . 3 [1984] 46). For coins of Imperial date (Marcus Aurelius, Gordian, and Philip) showing two Nemeses appearing to the sleeping Alexander see, for example, Mionnet, 3: 231, nos. 1296-97; 250, nos. 1410-11; id., Suppl. 6: 343, no. 1707; <hi rend="italic">BMC Ionia</hi> , 279, no. 346; 294, no. 442; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (von A) 2231; see also Leschhorn, <hi rend="italic"> Gründer</hi> , 217-18. Cadoux (95-97) noted several possible grounds that could be alleged for treating the story relating to Alexander and Smyrna as legendary. Among other things he pointed out <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> the lateness of the evidence and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> the fact that Strabo attributed the new foundation to Antigonos and Lysimachos, not Alexander. Nevertheless he doubted "whether these difficulties make the legendary character of the story (the existence of which has in any case to be accounted for) more probable than its substantial truthfulness" and suggested that Alexander "seriously initiated the project of a restoration, but was prevented by circumstances from executing it." Cook pointed out that the evidence of the black-glazed pottery from the uppermost level at Old Smyrna suggests that habitation there ended within Alexander's lifetime and "offers strong support to the local tradition which attributes the foundation to Alexander himself" (34). He also said that the lack of street drainage mentioned by Strabo (14.1.37) "might</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_182" n="182"/>
               <p>possibly be argued as showing that Smyrna was an earlier foundation than the new cities of the diadochs" (34 n. 103). Hence he suggests that the new city may date to 334 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> He notes correctly, however, that "default of excavation in early Hellenistic levels" at the new Smyrna makes it impossible to fix a date for the foundation (34). N. Demand speculates (<hi rend="italic">Urban Relocation</hi> , 156-63) that, as he did at Ilion, Alexander may have suggested moving the city and made appropriate promises but left the actual work to Antigonos. There is, however, nothing to indicate whether Antigonos undertook this project while Alexander was alive. Furthermore, in the case of Antigoneia (the later Alexandreia) Troas we know that Antigonos founded it after 311 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Regarding the type of synoecism involved in the refounding of Smyrna, Kahrstedt points out (<hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Synoikismos," 1442,) it was probably that of an existing political union creating a city <hi rend="italic"> Zentrum</hi> rather than a combining of poleis.</p>
               <p>2. Wehrli does not include Smyrna among the <hi rend="bold">foundations of Antigonos</hi> because he considers Smyrna to have regained the status of polis by the early fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Antig</hi> . 92, following Bickerman's review of Tscherikower in <hi rend="italic">Gnomon</hi> 4 [1928] 351-52). The evidence adduced by Bickerman and Wehrli is <hi rend="italic"> Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 136, an Athenian inscription of 387/6 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> that mentions Smyrna (1. 19), and a silver tetradrachm that may possibly be assigned to the early fourth century (H. Weber, in <hi rend="italic">Corolla Numismatica</hi> [Oxford, 1906] 298-99, pl. 15, no. 6; see also <hi rend="italic"> HN</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 591-92; K. Regling, <hi rend="italic"> ZfN</hi> 33 [1922] 65, no. 2). But the inscription shows that by this time Smyrna was a flourishing town, not necessarily a polis. The coin, though bearing the legend <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00190.gif"/>, is <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> not firmly dated and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> so similar to Kolophonian coins of the early fourth century that the suggestion has been made that it was a Kolophonian issue struck for the Smyrnaians (Cook, 33-34 and n. 99; cf. Cadoux, 92). Scylax (fl. mid-fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ) mentions Smyrna among the towns of the Asia Minor coast (98 [<hi rend="italic">GGM</hi> , 1: 71]); his only comment is <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00191.gif"/>, and this hardly proves that Smyrna was a polis in the mid-fourth century! For the involvement of some Smyrnaians in the Kolophonian resistance to Lysimachos, probably c. 295/294 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , see Paus. 7-3.4 and KOLOPHON.</p>

Both <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> Cop and von A, following Milne (pp. 3-5), assign the Eurydikeia coinage to 288-281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> This dating should be modified for two reasons: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Milne arrived at the upper date by reference to Ephesos, which he believed was renamed at that time (p. 4).

               <p>4. For the surviving bits of <hi rend="bold">the wall attributed to Lysimachos</hi> see Cadoux, 102f. <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> II<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 663 records an Athenian honorific decree of 285 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> for Artemidoros the son of Apollodoros. The inscription also mentions "King Lysimachos" (1. 18 and restored in 1. 3). A. C. Johnson (<hi rend="italic">AJA</hi> 18 [1914] 173) suggested restoring Artemidoros' demotic in line 17 as [<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00193.gif"/>]. Furthermore, pointing to the fact that the names Artemidoros and Apollodoros appear on Smyrnaian coins of the second century, Johnson also suggested that Artemidoros may have persuaded Lysimachos to refound Smyrna. However, Artemidoros was almost certainly a citizen of Perinthos, not Smyrna: (2. Habicht (<hi rend="italic">Chiron 2</hi> [1972] 107-9) has called attention to a decree from Hellenistic Ephesos (<hi rend="italic">GIBM</hi> 464) that honored an Artemidoros, a citizen of Perinthos who was the son of Apollodoros. As Habicht points out, the fact that the name, the patronymic, and the time period are the same in both inscriptions indicates we are dealing with the same person.</p>

               <p>Kolophon was an old Greek city that had been a member of the Athenian Empire in the fifth century. A decree of the <hi rend="italic">demos</hi> of Kolophon, dating from 311-306 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> , orders the construction of a wall to enlarge the city by</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_184" n="184"/>
               <p>enclosing both Kolophon and an abandoned site (the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00194.gif"/>) adjacent to Kolophon. Appended to the decree is a list of those subscribing to a loan raised for building the wall. The remains of the wall have been dated, on the basis of appearance, to the end of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> While Antigonos Monophthalmos is not specifically mentioned in connection with this project, it is quite possible, as some scholars have suggested, that he played a "behind-the-scenes" role in bringing it about. In any event, the opening lines of the decree (11. 5-6) mention that Antigonos confirmed Alexander's recognition of Kolophon's freedom.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The decree ordering the construction of the wall is also important because it provides useful information about the mechanism for founding a city.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Responsibility lay essentially with a ten-man commission that was charged with (1) planning the walls, (2) choosing an architect and determining his salary, (3) raising funds from outside sources (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00195.gif"/>), (4) overseeing the placement of roads and building lots as well as the sale (or lease) of these, and (5) planning an agora and workshops as well as other public buildings. A religious ceremony, headed by a priest of Apollo together with the other priests, priestesses, the <hi rend="italic">prytanis</hi> , the council, and the persons appointed in the decree, preceded the formal initiation of the project. From other inscriptions of this period we learn that at this time Kolophon and the port of Notion were united in a <hi rend="italic">sympoliteia</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After Ipsos, Kolophon fell to Lysimachos. Pausanias (1.9.7) says that Lysimachos destroyed it (and Lebedos) and transferred the population to his new foundation of Arsinoe Ephesos. In other passages he describes Kolophon as "deserted" (7.3-4) and Lebedos as "ruined" (7.3.5) as a result of Lysimachos' actions. Pausanias also says (7.3.4) that the Kolophonians (and the Smyrnaians) fought a battle against Lysimachos. Although he does not give a date for this, it is reasonable to assume that the battle came about from resistance to Lysimachos' plans; if so, it will have taken place somewhere around 294 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> We do not have any further information about Kolophon until after the arrival of the Seleucids in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Kolophon was minting coinage as early as the late sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and continued to mint in the Hellenistic period.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The remains of Kolophon are to be found at the village of Degirmendere, approximately sixty-five kilometers south of Izmir.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi>

               <p>1. For <hi rend="bold">the decree ordering the construction of the wall</hi> see B. D. Meritt, <hi rend="italic">AJP</hi> 56 (1935) 358-72 no. I (= Maier, <hi rend="italic"> Gr. Mauer</hi> ., 1: no. 69, with bibliography and commentary). Meritt dated the decree to 334 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , i.e., immediately after</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_185" n="185"/>
               <p>Alexander's conquest (p. 371). However, L. Robert has demonstrated that the decree most probably belongs to the period 311-306 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> [1936] 158-61; see also A. Wilhelm, in <hi rend="italic">Studies Buckler</hi> , 350-51). Another very fragmentary inscription (Meritt, 372-77, no. II = Maier, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Mauer</hi> ., 1: no. 70) mentions the sum of thirty talents in regard to the building of the wall (presumably the Antigonid one, ll. 74 and 84). It is unclear whether this was the total cost of the project (see Maier, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Mauer</hi> ., 1: 235; Wilhelm, 358). For a description of the remains of the wall see C. Schuchhardt, <hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 11 (1886) 402-7, who noted its similarity to the wall of Ephesos and dated it to the time of Lysimachos; see also L. B. Holland, <hi rend="italic">Hesperia</hi> 13 (1944) 170 (map of site on p. 92) and ARSINOE Ephesos. For the expression <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00196.gif"/> (1. 9) see L.

                  <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> , 62; Maier, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Mauer</hi> ., 1: 227-28. Holland suggested that at the end of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Kolophon proper was located on the acropolis and the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00197.gif"/> was a "long ledge of rock to the north of the acropolis" (170-71). Picard thought (<hi rend="italic">Ephèse et Claros</hi> [Paris, 1922] 635) that the wall enclosed Kolophon and Notion (Kolophon by the Sea). But Robert correctly pointed out that the distance between the two sites—13 km—rendered this unlikely (<hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> [1936] 158 n. 6). While the term <hi rend="italic">palaia polis</hi> refers to an abandoned site near Kolophon, the expression <hi rend="italic">archaia polis</hi> was used by the Kolophonians to describe the city itself as opposed to Kolophon by the Sea, which was another name for Notion; <hi rend="italic">I. Mag</hi> . 53-75-79. See A. Frickenhaus, <hi rend="italic"> Bonner Jahrbücher</hi> 118 (1909) 17-33; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> (1936) 158 n. 6.</p>
               <p>2. Wilhelm thought that the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00198.gif"/> announced to the Athenians by a Kolophonian embassy in 306/5 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> II<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 470b.6-7) referred to <hi rend="bold">Antigonos' confirmation of Kolophon's freedom</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Studies Buckler</hi> , 345-50). He also suggested that there was a connection between the building of the wall and the confirmation of the city's freedom and that Antigonos encouraged the enlargement of the city (350-51; see also Wehrli, 90).</p>

               <p>5. On the <hi rend="bold">destruction of Kolophon and Lebedos</hi> see Wilhelm, in <hi rend="italic">Studies Buckler</hi> , 364-65, J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic"> Claros</hi> , 82-83. Knibbe (<hi rend="italic">RE</hi> Suppl. XII, s.v. "Ephesos," 256) and Magic (<hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 80, 898; see also C. Fredrich, <hi rend="italic"> AM</hi> 25 [1900] 105) have argued that since there is evidence for the existence of both cities later in the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , the destruction and depopulation cannot have been as complete as Pausanias describes. Knibbe and Magic arc quite correct that there/s evidence for the existence of Kolophon under the Seleucids, i.e., in the period after 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> : a fragmentary inscription from the city records the name of the tribe Seleuk[is] (Meritt, 380-81, no. VI); the same tribe is also attested in a decree from Klaros dated to the latter part of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> (J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Claros</hi> , "Décrct pour</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_186" n="186"/>
               <p>Ménippos," p. 66, col. III.21). Furthermore as a result of the American excavation of 1922 at Kolophon nine bronzes of Antiochos II that had been struck at Sardis were discovered (Holland, <hi rend="italic">Hesperia</hi> 13 [1944] 143; Kinns, "Coinage of Ionia," 604-8, 617, nos. 127-35). There is also evidence for an Antiocheia festival at Kolophon (P. Frisch, <hi rend="italic">ZPE</hi> 13 [1974] 112-16 and 15 [1974] 98). Finally, at some point in the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , Kolophon received an embassy from Priene (<hi rend="italic">I. Priene</hi> 57). As for Lebedos, its representatives appear in a decree of Ionian cities in honor of Antiochos I (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 222.47 = <hi rend="italic">I. Erythrai u. Klazomenai</hi> 504). On the other hand, at Kolophon the American excavation did find evidence for destruction and/or desertion at the end of the fourth century (Holland, 169; Kinns, "Coinage of Ionia," 305-6; unfortunately the expedition could not continue beyond 1922 because of the unsettled conditions at the time). The fact that both cities existed later in the third century says nothing about the nature or extent of Lysimachos' actions against them. It is, after all, quite conceivable that, as Pausanias says, Lysimachos <hi rend="italic">did</hi> destroy and depopulate them and that they were later refounded. Of course the "destruction" of a city could take a number of forms: the physical destruction of the acropolis or buildings in the city, the demolition of parts or all of its walls, or the deprivation of its rights as an independent, corporate body, i.e., the reduction of it to the status of a village; see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Gnomon</hi> 42 (1970) 597-98. Pausanias' narrative (and the archaeological evidence in the case of Kolophon) suggests the destruction of Kolophon and Lebedos was of the former variety and that it involved a general depopulation.</p>
               <p>The decree for Meinippos noted above twice mentions the existence of a Prepelaion (J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Claros</hi> , pp. 63-64, col. I.23, 36). This has prompted the Roberts to suggest that after Ipsos Kassandros' general, Prepelaos, entered into the service of his ally, Lysimachos (on Prepelaos see Olshausen, <hi rend="italic"> Prosopographie</hi> , 9-11 n. 4, and ARSINOE Ephesos). They further suggest that in this capacity Prepelaos intervened with the king in order to rebuild Kolophon after its recent destruction (<hi rend="italic">Claros</hi> , 77-84). This is, of course, only a hypothesis. However, it does explain the existence of the Prepelaion, a sanctuary that probably held the tomb of Prepelaos and could have been consecrated to him as the new founder of Kolophon; cf. PYRRHEION.</p>
               <p>Pausanias says (7.3.4) that the graves of the Kolophonians and Smyrnaians who died fighting Lysimachos were on the side of the road to Klaros. In fact two tombs on this road have been discovered (Schuchhardt, <hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 11 [1886] 414-15). Schuchhardt suggested these were graves of men killed in Lysimachos' operations in the area in 302 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> If so, they would not likely be the tombs of Kolophonians, since at that time, according to Diod. 20.107.5, Kolophon did not resist Kassandros' general, Prepelaos; see Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 916, 920-21.</p>

               <p>The old city of Priene was probably relocated (and refounded) in the latter half of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> It is not possible, however, to specify whether a Hekatomnid or Alexander the Great refounded it.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> At the very least it is clear that Alexander took a significant interest in the city.

               <p>In a recent study Hornblower has noted (<hi rend="italic">Mausolus</hi> , 323-30) among other things that <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> in an Argive <hi rend="italic"> theorodokoi</hi> list of the 330s of Ionian cities (P.

Regling, <hi rend="italic">Die Münzen von Priene</hi> [Berlin, 1927] 47, no. 47); see also van Berchem, 200-201. Hornblower argues that both phenomena can be explained if we assume that between the 390s and the 330s Priene effectively did not exist and was replaced by Naulochon, its harbor city. But this argument is <hi rend="italic">ex silentio</hi> , as Hornblower admits (327; cf. S. Sherwin-White, <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 105 [1985] 88-89). Hornblower also brings positive considerations in favor of Alexander (328): <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> he may have refounded Smyrna and Alinda, so a refoundation of Priene would not be implausible; <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> his special interest in Priene is clear from</p>

               <p>his dedication of the Athena Polias temple (<hi rend="italic">I. Priene</hi> 156 = A.J. Heisserer, <hi rend="italic">Alexander the Great and the Greeks</hi> [Norman, Okla., 1980] 143). There was a local tradition at Smyrna for Alexander as founder, but it is all late (see Cadoux, <hi rend="italic"> Ancient Smyrna</hi> , 95-97; and EURYDIKEIA Smyrna). In fact, Strabo ascribes the founding of (Eurydikeia) Smyrna to Antigonos Monophthalmos and Lysimachos (14.1.37). As for Alinda, its refounding as an Alexandreia, while likely, is not definite, nor is the founder known (see ALEXANDREIA by Latmos). Suggestions also include the Carian queen Ada, Lysimachos, and Anfigonos Monophthalmos. In any event it is well to recall that there is no settlement in Asia Minor that can unequivocally be ascribed to Alexander; see further, Appendix II. With regard to <hi rend="bold">the date of the Athena temple</hi> , J. C. Carter originally suggested that construction began in the mid-fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and that Alexander merely completed it (<hi rend="italic">The Sculpture of the Sanctuary of Athena Polias at Priene</hi> [London, 1983] 25-31; see also P. Hellström and T. Thieme, <hi rend="italic">Labraunda</hi> I.3: The <hi rend="italic">Temple of Zeus</hi> [Stockholm, 1982] 45-56, who, on the basis of similarities between the Mausoleum at Halikarnassos, the temple of Zeus at Labraunda, and the Athena temple at Priene, likewise suggested that the latter dated to the mid-fourth century). In 1988, relying especially on C. V. Crowther's down-dating of <hi rend="italic">I. Priene</hi> 3 (decree in honor of Megabyzos) from c. 334/3 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> to the 290s, he suggested the temple "was completed after a pause of fifty years in the 290's" (<hi rend="italic">Akten des XIII. internationalen Kongresses Jür klassische Archäologie, Berlin</hi> 1988 [Mainz, 1990] 133-34).</p>
               <p>A date in the mid-fourth century for the relocation has also been suggested. Thus, Hiller von Gaertringen suggested it was Athens that supported the refounding, soon after Mausolos' death (<hi rend="italic">I. Priene</hi> , XI, 10 [commentary on no. 5.19], and 204), while Bean and Cook thought it was the Hekatomnids (<hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> 52 [1957] 141). Finally N. Demand has argued against relocation, i.e., that the city had never ceased to exist (<hi rend="italic">Phoenix</hi> 40 [1986] 35-44 and <hi rend="italic">Urban Relocation</hi> , 140-46).</p>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Ptolemais Lebedos</head>
               <p>Lebedos attracted the attention of a number of Hellenistic rulers. At the end of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> (probably between 306 and 302 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ) Antigonos wanted to transfer its inhabitants to Teos in an attempt to unite the two cities. In the process Lebedian homes were to be razed. The plan was not completed. Later on (c. 290 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ) Lysimachos transferred Lebedians and Kolophonians to Arsinoe, his refoundation of Ephesos.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>
               </p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_189" n="189"/>
               <p>A Ptolemais in Ionia and its identification with Lebedos are nowhere attested in the literary evidence. The earliest indication of its existence was numismatic. Waddington assigned coins of Ptolemais to Lebedos, though he did not give his reasons for so doing. In 1902 Dieudonné showed conclusively that certain coins with the legend <hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> TO may be ascribed to Lebedos.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Dieudonné was apparently unaware of the publication in 1900 of <hi rend="italic">I. Mag</hi> . 53, a Magnesian inscription of the late third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> that mentioned "Ptolemaians who were previously called Lebedians" (ll. 79-81). Then in 1946 L. Robert published a fragment of a Delphic <hi rend="italic"> theorodokoi</hi> list that probably dates to between 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and records a Ptolemais between Ephesos and Teos.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is at present no extant evidence to pinpoint when the name Ptolemais was first imposed. Furthermore we do not know when the Ptolemies first got control of Lebedos nor if possession was continuous until the end of the third century. The city joined other Ionian towns in honoring Antiochos I in 266 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> or soon after that (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 222). And inasmuch as Ptolemy II Philadelphos lost control of Ionia during the Second Syrian War, it is probable that Ptolemy III Euergetes I, who reconquered southern Ionia during the Third Syrian War, was the founder rather than his father. If this is correct, then it is likely that the portraits of the king and queen on coins of Ptolemais are those of Ptolemy III and Berenike II rather than of Philadelphos and Arsinoe II. The discovery at Lebedos of a fragment of an inscription that names Ptolemy III Euergetes and Berenike II lends support to the claim that he founded Ptolemais. Presumably the name change did not last beyond 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when Antiochos III captured Ephesos (<hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 260 F46). In any event an inscription discovered in the Heraion at Samos and dated to the early second century records a decree of "the Lebedians."<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lebedos was located near the village of Urkmez on the Kisik (formerly Xingi) peninsula, thirty-six kilometers northwest of Ephesos.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>

In another passage (7.3.5) he describes Lebedos as "ruined" following Lysimachos' actions. The likelihood is that the transfer involved most, if not all, of the population.

Dieudonné's identification was based, in the main, on two arguments: Korabos, one of the magistrates whose name appears on coins of Ptolemais, is also found on those of Hellenistic Lebedos (cf., for example, <hi rend="italic">SAG</hi> [von A] 2027 and <hi rend="italic">Inv. Wadd</hi> . 1711; Dieudonné's claim [54] that the name Korabos is found only at Lebedos is no longer correct; see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 106 [1982] 324). And Athena, who is frequently represented on Lebedian coins, often appears on the coinage of Ptolemais (<hi rend="italic">JIAN</hi> 5 [1902] 53-57). It is necessary to distinguish between <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> coins with <hi rend="Symbol"> P</hi> TO<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> EMAIE<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N, <hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> TO<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> EMAI, or <hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> TO<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> E without a magistrate's name but with an amphora (and, occasionally, a bird) and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> coins with the abbreviation <hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> TO, a magistrate's name, and a portrait of a king or queen. Waddington classified both kinds with Lebedos, though Dieudonné noted there was no firm argument for assigning group <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to Lebedos (<hi rend="italic">JLAN</hi> 5 [1902] 51-53; see also K.

               <p>This is awkward because in l. 11 we clearly read <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00201.gif"/>. He admitted the difficulty caused by his proposed restoration in that Lebedos was known as Ptolemais at the time of the inscription and Ptolemais was actually named in the list. To resolve the problem he suggested a number of solutions: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> there was an error in compiling the list (Daux rejected this possibility), <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> the list dates to before the refounding, <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> Lebedos was never renamed (and, hence, the Ptolemais of line 11 was some town other than Lebedos); Ptolemais was a foundation populated by former Lebedians but distinct from Lebedos, which continued to exist as a separate city. Daux's restoration creates more difficulties than it solves; it is not convincing. Robert restored l. 17: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00202.gif"/>.</p>

Poss</hi> ., 169-70; Huss, <hi rend="italic">Aussen</hi> ., 207. For the discovery by B. Ögün of the <hi rend="bold">fragment of an inscription that names Ptolemy III Euergetes and Berenike</hi> see P. Herrmann, <hi rend="italic"> Anadolu</hi> 9 (1965) 114 n. 141. Svoronos believed Philadelphos was the founder of Ptolemais (<hi rend="italic">JLAN</hi> 5 [1902] 68). He suggested that most of the portraits on the bronzes of Ptolemais are of Philadelphos and Arsinoe (68-69; though Svoronos did believe that one tetradrachm at least had Euergetes on it [69]; see also <hi rend="italic"> HN</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 580; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [Cop] <hi rend="italic"> Ionia</hi> 788-89). This identification has been generally—and correctly—rejected in favor of Ptolemy III Euergetes I and Berenike II. Kinns ("Coinage of Ionia," 253-55), for example, pointed out that a coin of Marathos in Phoenicia that served as part of the basis for Svoronos's identification (<hi rend="italic">JIAN</hi> 5 [1902] 67) was misdated by him. The coin in question is dated 34. Svoronos took this to be based on a Ptolemaic (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi> ) era beginning in 312/311 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Thus he dated the coin to 279/8 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and identified the queen as Arsinoe II. However, Seyrig has demonstrated that the era on the coins of Marathos is the same as that in use at Arados, which began in 260/59 (<hi rend="italic">RN</hi> [1964] 45-47); thus the coin is to be dated to 227/6. Furthermore, Kinns notes that the portrait cannot be a posthumous one of Arsinoe II because the tokens of her deification, the scepter behind the head and the horn at the ear, are lacking. For the identification of the king and queen as Ptolemy III and Berenike II see, in addition to Kinns, Dieudonné (<hi rend="italic">JLAN</hi> 5 [1902] 58-60), Imhoof-Blumer (<hi rend="italic">Gr.

               <p>Suggestions regarding possible restorations for -aleia have run the gamut, both morphologically and geographically. Sestini thought it was Pakaleia (see <hi rend="italic">CIG</hi> 3568; I have not seen Sestini's original publication, <hi rend="italic">Viaggi ed opusculi diversi</hi> [Berlin, 1807] 136). Waddington believed the reading was <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00223.gif"/> for <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00224.gif"/>, and hence that the soldiers came from the coastal region of Ionia and Caria and were on their way back to Thrace (LW III. 1766 and pp. 259-60). Writing in 1907 Radet hypothesized that Paraleia was really Parableia near Mugla in southeast Carla (<hi rend="italic">Rev. Hist</hi> . 95 [1907] 154). Earlier, in 1897, Radet had suggested that the soldiers were from Pakaleia, the plain east of Amorion in Phrygia (<hi rend="italic">La Lydie</hi> , 35 n. 3). However, the name of this plain was Pankaleia, not Pakaleia, and it is known only from the Byzantine period (Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 231; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 77 n. 6). Marshall believed the soldiers were from Nakaleia (which he claimed is a variant spelling for "Nakoleia") in Phrygia (<hi rend="italic">GIBM</hi> 4.2: pp. 147-48, following Boeckh's commentary on <hi rend="italic"> CIG</hi> 3568; see also E.

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Apollonia on the Maeander (Tripolis)</head>
               <p>We can trace three names for the city known to us in the Hellenistic period as Apollonia: Apollonia, Antoniopolis, and Tripolis. Unlike the later names for the town, there is no literary evidence for the name Apollonia. In fact its earlier existence as an Apollonia was suggested for the first time in 1896 by Imhoof-Blumer. His evidence was numismatic. He pointed out that the coin type with a horseman (or Amazon) on horseback above the Maeander symbol occurs on certain coins with the legend A<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> O<hi rend="Symbol">LLW</hi> NIAT<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N and on coins of Tripolis under Augustus. In 1914 A. Rehm published an inscription from Miletos, dated to around 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , which mentions an <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00225.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00226.gif"/>.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> This inscription proves the existence of a city by that name; it does not, however, prove the identification of Apollonia on the Maeander with Tripolis. Nevertheless the identification is highly plausible and may be accepted. It can also be assumed that a coin with the ethnic A<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> O<hi rend="Symbol">LLW</hi> NIAT<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N and the Maeander symbol should be attributed to Apollonia on the Maeander rather than some other like-named city.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no explicit evidence to indicate that Apollonia on the Maeander was an Attalid foundation. The suggestion that it was Attalid is based solely on the city name.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> On the other hand, an inscription recording a decree of "Apollonia" and dated palaeographically to the early third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (i.e., before the ascendancy of the Attalids) has been attributed to this city. Furthermore, the presence of Ionicisms in the decree suggests Apollonia may have been an old Ionian city rather than a Hellenistic foundation.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Apollonia adopted the name Antoniopolis in honor of the triumvir Marcus Antonius possibly as early as 41 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> , when Antony was in Asia Minor. After the overthrow of Antony the city took the name Tripolis.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>

For example, Waddington (<hi rend="italic">Voyage num</hi> ., 140, following Mionnet, 3: 331, no. 164) grouped such coins with APOLLONIA in Phrygia.

On the other hand, the Roberts (<hi rend="italic">La Carie</hi> , 2: 256) rightly object to Head's attempt (<hi rend="italic">BMC Lydia</hi> , cxlviii) to attribute to Apollonia on the Maeander certain other coins without the Maeander symbol. On the general question of the attribution of Apollonia coins see J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">La Carie</hi> , 2: 237ff., 245ff.</p>
               <p>3. For <hi rend="bold">Apollonia as an Attalid foundation</hi> see, for example, Tscherikower, 26; Hansen (<hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 177) attributes it to Attalos II, whale Ramsay suggests it was founded by the Attalids to counter the Seleucid Laodikeia (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 1: 192-93). J. and L. Robert disputed the connection of the city with the Attalids (<hi rend="italic">REA</hi> 36 [1934] 525-26 and <hi rend="italic">La Carie</hi> , 2: 239 n. 2, 241). They point out that there is a confusion between the city names Apollonis and Apollonia. The former, they suggest, was in honor of the wife of Attalos I; the latter, for the god Apollo. With specific regard to Apollonia on the Maeander, they claim that <hi rend="italic">I. Milet</hi> 74.2-3 shows the city existed prior to the period of Attalid domination in the area.</p>
               <p>The Roberts base the latter argument on the dating of <hi rend="italic">I. Milet</hi> 74 to c. 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> This dating, however, is tentative. The Roberts' doubts about an Attalid origin for Apollonia on the Maeander were reinforced by the attribution of the Apollonia decree to Apollonia on the Maeander (see below, note 4).</p>

               <p>Strabo tells us (13.4.4) that Apollonis was named in honor of the Attalid queen Apollonis, the wife of Attalos I and the mother of Eumenes II and Attalos II.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> A fragmentary decree (KP II.113) records that the city was established through a synoecism.

However, the presence of Macedonian names in ephebic lists of Apollonis during the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and the Macedonian shield on coins of Apollonis from the same period indicate that military colonists also formed part of the founding population of the new city.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Some of these colonists may have been at the site before the synoecism. Others may have come from Macedonian military colonies in the neighborhood. Epigraphic evidence of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> proves the existence of at least two Macedonian colonies in the vicinity, one at Doidye and one at -espoura. These colonies were probably in the territory of Apollonis. The village of Kamai was also in the vicinity.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Apollonis is one of a number of Attalid colonies in which Herakles was venerated.</p>
               <p>The date of the founding of Apollonis is unclear. Most likely it was established on the occasion of, or soon after, the death of Queen Apollonis, which may have occurred as early as 183 or as late as 159 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> The synoecism and also the fact that Apollonis minted coins and had ephebes, gymnasiarchs, ephebarchs, and <hi rend="italic">stephanephoroi</hi> in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> indicate that it was a polis at this time.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> During Aristonikos' uprising the city came under his control (Strabo 14.1.38).

               <p>According to Stephanos (s.v. "Attaleia") Attaleia was originally called Agroeira or Alloeira. It is generally agreed that this Attaleia, which Stephanos and other Byzantine authors place in Lydia,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> is the same town as that mentioned in the agreement made between Eumenes I and some soldiers stationed in Attaleia. It is not clear, however, whether Eumenes or his predecessor, Philetairos, founded Attaleia.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> We know nothing about the civic organization of Attaleia in Hellenistic times; the soldiers mentioned in the Attaleia agreement were organized under a commanding officer and <hi rend="italic">hegemones</hi> . Under the Roman Empire the city had a <hi rend="italic">boule</hi> and <hi rend="italic">demos</hi> that regularly passed decrees.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The extant coinage dates only from the second and third centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"> A.D.</hi>

               <p>1 The new <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list from Sardis (C. Habicht, <hi rend="italic"> JRS</hi> 65 [1975] 65, II.7, late first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ) includes Attaleia under Pergamon, as does Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.126). However at sec. 121 Pliny mentions a number of Aeolian cities inland from Kyme and Myrina, among them a certain Itale. A possible emendation has "Attalia"; see the Teubner Pliny (ed. C. Mayhoff [1906; reprint, Stuttgart, 1967]). Hierokles (670.5) and the <hi rend="italic">Not. Ep</hi> . (1160, etc.), as well as Stephanos, place it in Lydia. Attaleia in Lydia should be distinguished from Attalia on the coast of Mysia opposite Lesbos, which is recorded on the <hi rend="italic">Tab. Peut</hi> . (VIII.4) and which is probably to be identified with Attea of the same region mentioned by Strabo (13. 1.51; on the complex problem of identifying, locating, and distinguishing this Attea and the one that issued coinage in the second and third centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"> A.D.</hi> see H. von Fritze, <hi rend="italic">Ant.

Kiepert suggested that Strabo mistakenly wrote "Attea" for "Attalia" (as it is on the <hi rend="italic">Tab.

                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 22) and Magie (980) suggested Eumenes I as the <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> . They speculated that Eumenes founded it after his victory over Antiochos I at Sardis and named it for his grandfather, i.e., Philetairos' father. Allen (<hi rend="italic">Attalid Kingdom</hi> , 24, and <hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> 66 [1971] 3 and n. 12) suggested that Attaleia was completed <hi rend="italic"> before</hi> the battle of Sardis and, hence, that it was founded by</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_206" n="206"/>
               <p>Philetairos. It is, however, also possible that Eumenes I founded Attaleia in the period between his accession and the battle of Sardis; see further the discussion in PHILETAIREIA.</p>

The <hi rend="bold"> ethnic</hi> on both inscriptions and coins for Attaleia in Lydia is ATTA<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> EATH<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> ; for ATTALEIA in Pamphylia it is <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00247.gif"/> (L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> Suppl. 1 [1973] 437; <hi rend="italic">HN</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 648; see also ATTALEIA in Aetolia). Pliny, however, has "Attalenses" (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.126) just as he writes "Panteenses" for "Pantheotae" (see Habicht, <hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> 65 [1975] 80).</p>
               <p>5. In the course of the last century and a half conjectures about the <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of Attaleia have moved progressively northward. Hamilton believed it was at the site of the present Adala, basing his suggestion on the homonymous names (<hi rend="italic">Researches</hi> , 1: 43; against this see Radet, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 11 [1887] 170; Robert, <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 100-102). Fontrier, relying on an incorrect restoration of an inscription found at Mermere (between Sardis and Thyateira), placed the town there (<hi rend="italic">Mous. k. Bibl</hi> . 5 [1886] 48f.; contra, Radet, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> [1887] 170-75, 397-98). With the discovery of a decree of Attaleia north of Thyateira Radet was able to suggest that the location was at Gördük Kale (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> [1887] 173-75). Further investigation by Keil and von Premerstein (KP II, pp. 60-61) suggested that the site was at Yaran Tepe, a quarter hour south-southwest of Selçikli, while Schuchhardt (<hi rend="italic">Alt. v. Perg</hi> . I.1: 140, followed by C. Foss, <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> 37 [1987] 95) suggested a site called Karaman Mezar (now called Koca Mezarlik) southeast of Selçikli. On the location see further Robert, <hi rend="italic">RA</hi> (1934) 90-91; Virgilio, <hi rend="italic">SCO</hi> (1982) 115-19; Herrmann, <hi rend="italic">TAM</hi> V.2, p. 296 (map at end); Foss, 94-99 (map on p. 82).</p>
               <p>Attaleia, at the eastern extremity of Eumenes' empire, was located in the fertile upper Lykos Valley (on the identification of the Lykos see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Ét. anat</hi> ., 187 and n. 2). Fertility of the soil was undoubtedly an important factor in choosing the location, as L. Robert has argued (<hi rend="italic">RA</hi> [1934:] 90-92). However, despite the lack of strategic value of the site itself (Robert, 90-92), one should not overlook the proximity of the site to the Seleucid Thyateira, 13 km to the south (see Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 44 n.; Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 22; also Virgilio, 116-19). Despite their being founded by opposing monarchies the two cities had similar coin types in the second and third centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> (Head, <hi rend="italic">BMC Lydia</hi> , xxxvii).</p>

               <p>a Seleucid colony, we do not know who its founder was nor when it was founded.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Its location is also in doubt: most conjectures place it in the region north of ancient Apollonis.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>

               <p>1. Schulten thought Seleukos I was the <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> of Doidye (<hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi> 32 [1897] 529); Hansen suggested it was Antiochos I (<hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 174). For the probability that the Macedonian colony at Doidye was Seleucid in origin see the discussion on NAKRASON. For the possibility that the name Doidye may have originated in the European home of the original Macedonian settlers see Schuchhardt, <hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 13 (1888) 16; but cf. Bürchner (<hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Doidye"), who thought the name might be Carian. See also APOLLONIS and -ESPOURA. At one time Schuchhardt thought that Doidye was the original name of Apollonis and that the latter supplanted it (<hi rend="italic">AM</hi> [1888] 15-17, followed by Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 126). The principal objection raised against this hypothesis was that cistophori of Apollonis were dated to around 186 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> , while the date of the Doidye inscription (161/0 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ) indicated that Doidye coexisted with Apollonis (Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">Lyd. Stadt</hi> ., 26). In fact Robinson has since demonstrated conclusively that the cistophori of Apollonis should be dated to the third and fourth years of Aristonikos (<hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1954] 1-8). The founding date of Apollonis is not definitely known; most probably it was established between 183 and 159 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> See APOLLONIS. Schuchhardt later changed his view and suggested that Doidye was a smaller fortress approximately 500 meters north of Apollonis (<hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 24 [1899] 154-56, see map on p. 155; id., in <hi rend="italic">Alt. v.

                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 176).</p>
               <p>2. Suggestions for the <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of Doidye include Dereköy, approximately 2 km north (Radet, <hi rend="italic">De Coloniis</hi> , 17), and Jajaköy, 7 km north of Apollonis (Radet, <hi rend="italic">La Lydie</hi> , map; von Diest, <hi rend="italic">Von Perg</hi> ., 22; Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">Lyd. Stadt</hi> ., 26). In any event the fact that the inscription was discovered at Palamut, which is very close to the site of the ancient Apollonis, suggests that Doidye may have been in its territory (see KP I, p. 45; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Jewish Colonies</head>
               <p>Around the end of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> (probably between 212 and 205 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ) Antiochos III sent two thousand Babylonian Jews and their families to settle in the "garrisons and most important places" of Lydia and Phrygia. Our only source of information for this colonization is Josephus, who records the letter sent by the king to Zeuxis ordering the establishment of these settlements (<hi rend="italic">AJ</hi> 12.148-53). As the letter provides a detailed account of how a colony was founded, I quote it in full.</p>
               <q rend="blockquote">
                  <p>King Antiochos to Zeuxis, his father, greetings. If you are in good health, it is well. I am also in good health. It is necessary to give my very serious consideration to a revolt that I learn has broken out among the inhabitants of Lydia and Phrygia; and having consulted with my friends as to what should be done, I have decided to convey two thousand Jewish families with their effects from Mesopotamia and Babylonia to the garrisons and most important places. For I believe that because of their piety toward the Deity they will be loyal protectors of our interests; and I know that they are a people whose character was approved by my ancestors, both in regard to their trustworthiness and to their willingness to do what was asked of them. I wish, therefore, even if it is difficult, to move them, and since I promised, (I want them) to live under their own laws. When you have brought them to the aforementioned places, you will give to each of them a place for building a home as well as land for farming and for viticulture and you will grant a tax exemption often years on the produce of the earth. Until such time as they get harvests from the earth let there be measured out to them grain for their attendants. Let enough be given to those doing military service so that by receiving concessions from us they will show themselves all the more zealous to our cause. And take care of their people, as much as you can, so that they are not bothered by anyone.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Other than to say the colonies were set up in Lydia and Phrygia Josephus says nothing about the precise location of any of them.</p>
               <p>The scholarship on the letter of Antiochos III to Zeuxis is extensive and has been primarily concerned with the question of its authenticity; see, for example, the discussion and bibliography of R. Marcus in the Loeb Josephus, vol. 7, pp. 743-44, 764-66. To his bibliography add the following, who generally accept</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_213" n="213"/>
               <p>its authenticity: Rostovtzeff, <hi rend="italic">SEHHW</hi> , 492; Bickerman, in <hi rend="italic">Mélanges Lévy</hi> , 17ff.; Tcherikover, <hi rend="italic">HCJ</hi> , 287f. and notes; A.

               <p>Whether or not it is authentic, the letter remains a valuable source of information for the procedure followed in establishing a colony. For analysis and discussion see Schalit and Gauger, cited above, and Cohen, <hi rend="italic">Seleucid Colonies</hi> , 5-9. On the Jewish prowess in military affairs during the Hellenistic period, see Josephus (<hi rend="italic">AJ</hi> 12.119), who comments on the military service the Jews provided the Seleucid kings, and Seleukos Nikator's use of them as colonists; see also Schalit, 297-98; Cohen, <hi rend="italic">TAPA</hi> 103 (1972) 84 n. 5.</p>
               <p>Josephus nowhere specifies which were "<hi rend="bold">the garrisons and most important places.</hi> " New inscriptional evidence suggests that after the overthrow of Achaios in 214 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> , Antiochos III partly destroyed Sardis and then permitted a new <hi rend="italic">synoikismos</hi> . G. M. A. Hanfmann and J. C. Waldbaum have speculated that SARDIS was one of the "important places" to which the Jews were sent (<hi rend="italic">Essays in Honor of Nelson Glueck</hi> , ed. J. A.

               <p>In the past it has been claimed that Kadoi was a Macedonian colony.

However, in other references the name of the town is simply Kadoi, (or, on coins, the ethnic is KA<hi rend="Symbol">D</hi> OHN<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N) without any addition. Furthermore, the Flavian <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list from Ephesos, which records a list of communities in the province of Asia, mentions the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00264.gif"/> (I. 1) and the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00265.gif"/> (I. 6) as separate entities, not as a unit. This has prompted Christian Habicht to suggest, correctly, that in the text of Pliny there has to be a comma after <hi rend="italic">Macedones</hi> , in order to mark the separation from the following Cadieni.

                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 174); Magie (<hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 973) thought it might have been established by the Attalids.

Launey (<hi rend="italic">Recherches</hi> , 341 and 686, following a suggestion of Keil and von Premerstein, KP II, pp. 116-17) theorized that the colonists at Kobedyle had become citizens of the nearby Kastolos. However, it is not clear whether Kastolos was a polls in the Hellenistic period. A Hellenistic epitaph at Athens of a certain Menodotos records that he was a <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00270.gif"/> (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> II<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 9003; cf. Herrmann, <hi rend="italic">TAM</hi> V.1, p. 72); the use of the ethnic, without other supporting evidence, does not prove that at the time Kastolos was a polis (for the collected evidence on Kastolos see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Ét. anat</hi> ., 159-60; see also P. Debord, <hi rend="italic">REA</hi> 87 [1985] 349). That having been said, the direct link between the Macedonians at Kobedyle and Kastolos remains to be found.

Herrmann also conjectured that Lasnedda was in the territory of Hyrkanis (p. 43; see also J. and L. Robert <hi rend="italic">BE</hi> (1970) 516). If this suggestion is correct, it would mean that the Macedonian Hyrkanians controlled the mountainous region to the southeast as well as part of the Hyrkanian plain. However, it should be emphasized that the Lasnedda inscription provides firm evidence only for the geographical, not necessarily for the political, proximity of the two colonies. We do not know when, if ever, the colony of Lasnedda was incorporated in the territory of HYRKANIS (cf. THYATEIRA and MERNOUPHYTA). For another colony close to Hyrkanis see AGATHEIRA. The appearance of the god Papias in Lydia is surprising. Up until the discovery of the Lasnedda inscription Papias was known only in Phrygia (Herrmann and Polatkan, 45).</p>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Magnesia Near Sipylos</head>
               <p>The case of Magnesia near Sipylos is interesting because it provides us with an example of military colonists who were settled in an old Greek city. We learn about the colony from an inscription (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 229) that records three documents of c. 243 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> : (I) a decree of Smyrna concerning a treaty with Magnesia (ll. 1-34), (II) a treaty between the two cities (ll. 34-89), and (III) a decree of Smyrna concerning Palaimagnesia (ll. 89-108).<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The documents deal with the granting of citizenship by Smyrna to the Magnesians and Palaimagnesians.</p>
               <p>According to document II the population of Magnesia consisted of three groups, (I) soldiers in Magnesia, (2) those out in the open, and (3) native Magnesians: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00275.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00276.gif"/> The precise distinction between the first two groups has been the subject of much discussion. Among other things, scholars disagree as to whether the term <hi rend="italic">katoikoi</hi> refers only to the soldiers in Magnesia or to the soldiers out in the open as well. While no definitive answer can be given, it seems more likely that it includes all the soldiers.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The organization of the <hi rend="italic">katoikoi</hi> was essentially military. They were divided into <hi rend="italic">tagmata</hi> , and each <hi rend="italic">tagma</hi> had a secretary. There were also muster rolls for each group. Furthermore, at least some of the <hi rend="italic">katoikoi</hi> had land lots.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> We do not know whether those in the city lived in their homes, in barracks, or were billeted. Presumably those out in the open were bivouacked near Magnesia. The <hi rend="italic">katoikoi</hi> —and not the Magnesians—had the real power in the city: in the dealings with Smyrna it was the <hi rend="italic">katoikoi</hi> who handled most of the negotiations. With the signing of the treaty the whole population of Magnesia became citizens of Smyrna.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The inscription recording the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list of the Flavian province of Asia begins with the following names: "Makedones, Ankyranoi, Synaeitai, Mokadenoi, Kadyeneis ..." By comparison with the list that Pliny gives of the cities in the Sardian <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.111: <hi rend="italic">Macedones, Cadieni, Philadelphini</hi> ...) Habicht has shown that the first part of the inscription deals with the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> of Sardis. The first name on the inscription undoubtedly refers to the descendants of Macedonian colonists who were settled at some time in the Hellenistic period, and certainly is to be identified with the Macedonians recorded by Pliny. While the location of the settlement is not definitely known, the order in the inscription does show a general eastward progression. This suggests that the foundation was west of Ankyra, either on the Makestos (Simav) River or dose to it. Therefore it is possible, as Habicht has conjectured, that the Macedonians were located on the western shore of Lake Simav at the site of the present Kiliseköy.</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_218" n="218"/>
               <p>For the inscription recording the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list see Habicht, <hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> 65 (1975) 65, col. I.1, and commentary on pp. 71-72. For the separation of Macedones and Cadieni in the text of Pliny see Habicht, 72-73; and KADOI. Regarding the location of the places mentioned after Makedones: Kadoi was quite close to the modern Gediz (Buresch, <hi rend="italic">Aus Lydien</hi> , 155-58; see also Ruge, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Phrygia," 794, 833). The region Mokadene included Temenothyrai, Silandos, and the territory north of these cities (Habicht, 72). Synaos was on the site of Simav, just southeast of the lake of the same name (Buresch, <hi rend="italic">Aus Lydien</hi> , 142—43; L. Robert <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> , 95 n. 2; but cf. Drew-Bear, <hi rend="italic">Chiron</hi> 6 [1976] 291 n. 7). The location of Ankyra is not definitely known. Buresch thought it was at Kiliseköy (<hi rend="italic">Aus Lydien</hi> , 142). Waddington suggested it was northeast of the lake at Hasanlar (LW III. 1011, commentary). In this he was followed by L. Robert (<hi rend="italic">Gnomon</hi> 31 [1959] 19 n. 5); and by Habicht (72). The connection of Ankyra with Hasanlar leaves Kiliseköy open for another possible identification. On this basis Habicht suggested it is the site of the colony of the Makedones.</p>

The worship of Herakles is not surprising.

Nor do we know when the colony was founded. At the very least it is clear that the Attalids established a colony at Mernouphyta with an eye to Thyateira, either to counter it, if it was still Seleucid, or to control it, if it had come under Attalid rule.</p>

               <p>that the problem is complicated by the fact that we do not know exactly when and for how long before 189 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> the Attalids controlled the region around Thyateira. Prior to c. 226 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> it was Seleucid. From c. 226 to 223 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Attalos I was master of the area (Will, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 1: 296ff.). After losing it in 223 he regained it in 218 (Holleaux, <hi rend="italic">Ét</hi> ., 2: 17f.; Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 105); he had control of it in 201 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> when Philip marched on it (Polyb. 16.1.7). While it is not certain if the area remained under Pergamene rule long after 201, it is dear that in 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> the territory <hi rend="italic">circa Thyatiram</hi> was under Seleucid control (Livy 37.8.7, 37.6, 38.1). After the treaty of Apameia it passed permanently to the Attalids.

               <p>Mostene was probably not a Hellenistic colony.

               <p>Tacitus refers to <hi rend="italic">quique Mosteni aut Macedones Hyrcani vocantur</hi> . However, it has long been pointed out, by Ramsay and Tscherikower among others, that Tacitus is here referring to two separate cities.

               <p>2. Strabo mentions the presence of <hi rend="bold">Mysians and Macedonians in the area around Mount Tmolos</hi> (13.4.5; see MYSOTIMOLOS) and further on (13.4.12) says that parts of the Mesogis (apparently the central region) were inhabited by Mysians (on the Mysians see also Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 974; <hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 338.14).</p>
               <p>Ptolemy in fact places the Mysomakedones in Mysia (5.2.13). However, a city in the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> of Ephesos could not be located that far away. In any event the inscription from Antioch resolves the question in support of Pliny.</p>
               <p>For the view that the colony consisted of both Mysians and Macedonians see, for example, Keil, op. cit.; Buresch, <hi rend="italic">Aus Lydien</hi> , 180; Magie, 974; Robert, <hi rend="italic">ATAM</hi> , 336 n. 72; Leschhorn, 59-62.

               <p>3. For the likelihood that the Macedonian colonists in western Asia Minor were settled by the Seleucids rather than the Attalids see NAKRASON. Whereas the available evidence indicates that Macedonians are rarely found in the Attalid army (see NAKRASON), there is evidence for Mysians under Attalos I (<hi rend="italic">FD</hi> II.1, p. 224) and Eumenes II (Livy 42.57.7); note also that Mysians and Macedonians received citizenship after the death of Attalos III (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 338.14). Hence it is possible that the Mysians of the Mysomakedones were introduced by the Attalids rather than the Seleucids. Launey (<hi rend="italic">Recherhes</hi> , 444), Keil, and Ramsay thought it was a Seleucid colony; Hansen and Magie suggested it was Attalid.</p>
               <p>4. The precise <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of the settlement of the Mysomakedones is not yet known. Pliny's list of cities in the <hi rend="italic"> conventus</hi> of Ephesos includes the <hi rend="italic">Cilbiani inferiores et superiores, Mysomacedones, Mastaurenses, Briullitae, Hypaepeni, Dioshieritae</hi> . Ramsay thought the settlement of the Mysomakedones was southeast of Philadelpheia in the Üzüm Ovasi (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 196). Radet thought it was at Bulladan (<hi rend="italic">La Lydie</hi> , 315, and <hi rend="italic">De Colonüs</hi> , 28-29). However, Keil and von Premerstein correctly pointed out that since the Mysomakedones were in the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> of Ephesos, the colony was probably farther west (KP III, p. 58; Keil, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Mysomakedones"). Buresch suggested it was in the eastern Mesogis (<hi rend="italic">Aus Lydien</hi> , 180, and <hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 19 [1894] 123ff.; see also Tscherikower, 26). L. Robert would likewise locate it in the eastern part of the Mesogis range (<hi rend="italic">ATAM</hi> , 336-37, n. 72; though note that earlier, in <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 11-12</p>

                  </note> ). Pliny's list does allow our locating the settlement in the eastern Mesogis. In the absence of additional information, however, we can do no more than posit a location in that general area. For a map see KP III, end.</p>

It is possible that the Mysotimolitae originated as a colony in which Mysian veterans were combined with natives in the area of Mount Tmolos. The precise location of Mysotimolos cannot be fixed.

               <p>1. Among the Lydian cities, Ptolemy lists (5.2.14) Mostene, Hierokaisareia, Nakrasa, and Thyateira.

                  <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> , 75-76). However, the discovery that the name of the town was Nakrason (or Nakrasos) has shown that either restoration <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00296.gif"/> or <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00297.gif"/> may be appropriate (see Herrmann, op. cit.; J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1970] 512).</p>
               <p>3. Nakrason is one of a number of <hi rend="bold">colonies of Macedonians in Lydia</hi> ; others include AGATHEIRA, AKRASOS, DOIDYE, -ESPOURA, HYRKANIS, KOBEDYLE, and THYATEIRA; see also Appendix III. Although there is evidence indicating that Seleukos I founded Thyateira and that the settlers at Hyrkanis worshipped Zeus Seleukeios, the earliest information about most of the other colonies dates from the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , i.e., the period of Attalid rule. Nevertheless it is likely that the Macedonian colonies were founded by the Seleucids rather than the Attalids. This is because the available evidence indicates that Macedonians are frequently found in the Seleucid army; on the other hand, they are rarely found in the Attalid. For example, Polyaenus (4.9.5) says that in his campaign against Demetrios Poliorketes in 286/5 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Seleukos I Nikator sent out Lysias with a "great number" of Macedonians. Polyaenus (7.39) also mentions a revolt under a Seleukos (either I or II) that was put down by Macedonian and Thracian troops. And Antiochos I had Macedonians under his command in his war against the Gauls (Lucian <hi rend="italic">Zeuxis</hi> 11). The gap in our literary sources for the third century means that, except for Egypt where the papyri fill in, we know very little about the composition of the Hellenistic armies until Polybius and other</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_224" n="224"/>
               <p>sources pick up after 221 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> At that point we begin to get information about Macedonians in the Seleucid army. Thus we know of Macedonians or men armed in Macedonian fashion serving in the army of Antiochos III at Raphia in 217 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Polyb. 5.79.4f., 82.2-11), at Thermopylae in 190 (Livy 37.40.1; App. <hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 32), in the army of Antiochos IV at Jerusalem (Joseph. <hi rend="italic">AJ</hi> 12.252 and Hieronymus, <hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 260 F50), and at Daphne in 167/6 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Polyb. 30.25.5). In contrast we find only one definite reference to Macedonians in the Attalid army: when they were granted citizenship after the death of Attalos III in 133 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 338.14). Irrespective of whether or not the soldiers in the armies of Antiochos III and IV were real Macedonians or only armed "in the Macedonian fashion" (so, for example, Polyb. 5.82.10), the contrast between the evidence for the Seleucids and the Attalids is telling; see also Launey, <hi rend="italic">Recherches</hi> , 335-36; Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 973-74.</p>
               <p>Of course there were Attalid foundations in Lydia that included Macedonians in their population: APOLLONIS and PHILADELPHEIA, for example. Both of these were founded in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Undoubtedly the Macedonians were former Seleucid military colonists. It is a reasonable supposition, therefore, that, with the exception of Apollonis and Philadelpheia, most of the Macedonian colonies in Lydia attested under Pergamene rule were an Attalid inheritance from Seleucid rule.</p>
               <p>The period when Seleucid kings actually controlled western Asia Minor was relatively short: during the reigns of Seleukos I in the few months between Korupedion and his death, of Antiochos I, and of Antiochos II. After the death of the latter the careers of Antiochos Hierax, Achaios, and Attalos I, who was only too willing to take advantage of Seleucid weakness, effectively destroyed central Seleucid control over most of Asia Minor west of the Taurus Mountains. Antiochos III was briefly able to reassert his control over much of the area until, after the Peace of Apameia in 188 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , the Seleucids were permanently removed from western Asia Minor. Of these rulers one thinks of the energetic Antiochos I (so Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 174)—or perhaps Antiochos II—as a possible founder of Nakrason.</p>
               <p>An inscription from Bakir dated in the first year of a King Attalos (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 268) records the honors decreed for an <hi rend="italic"> epistates</hi> (l. 4) named Apollonios son of Meleager who had previously been a <hi rend="italic">strategos</hi> of the city (l. 10). The inscription also mentions the <hi rend="italic">prytaneion</hi> (l. 15) and <hi rend="italic"> tamias</hi> of the city (l. 20). If the decree could be assigned to Nakrason, it would provide useful information about the civic organization as early as 240 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and show that Nakrason was already then under Attalid control (see Keil, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Nakrasa"; Magic, 980). However, identification of the king as Attalos I is not certain; L. Robert suggests the king may be Attalos II or III. Furthermore he claims that the stele could just as easily have come from Akrasos or Stratonikeia, since inscriptions from all three cities have in the course of time been brought to Bahir and Kirkagaç (<hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>

               <p>Palaimagnesia was a fortress located in the vicinity of Magnesia near Sipylos.

The inhabitants included former <hi rend="italic">katoikoi</hi> in Magnesia as well as a Macedonian infantry unit under Timon and some Persians under Omanes.

To those without land they gave <hi rend="italic">kleroi hippikoi</hi> . Timon and his men received tax immunity, while Omanes, Menekles, and their men were given the normal pay and rations as well as the privileges conferred upon those from Magnesia. Along with these benefits, all the inhabitants of Palaimagnesia—the former Magnesian <hi rend="italic"> katoikoi</hi> , the garrison soldiers, and the troops under Menekles—were granted citizenship in Smyrna.</p>

               <p>In his enumeration of the cities in the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> of Pergamon Pliny lists the Hermocapelitae, Attalenses, Panteenses, and Apollonidienses (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.126). The Flavian <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list from Sardis records the following cities in the <hi rend="italic"> conventus</hi> of Pergamon: the Apollonideis, Indeipediatai, Hermokapeleitai, Pantheotai, and Attaleatai. The Pantheotai of the Flavian list are identical with the Panteenses; the latter is the Latin form of the Greek ethnic. Habicht called attention to a likely connection between the term "Pantheotai" and a pantheon and noted that the Attalids, especially Eumenes II, fostered the worship of "all gods." Therefore he suggested that the community of the Pantheotai originated as an Attalid settlement around a sanctuary of <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00299.gif"/>
                  <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Habicht has also suggested a location north of Apollonis, noting that the list of cities in both Pliny and the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list point in this direction.

By this time Panda was probably in the latter's territory. Therefore Robert argued that the Panteenses were located in the territory of Magnesia, in the region south of Apollonis, between it and Magnesia.</p>

               <p>In describing Philadelpheia Strabo comments on the frequency with which it was hit by earthquakes and expresses surprise at the founding of the city (12.8.18 and 13.4.10). Nevertheless it <hi rend="italic"> was</hi> founded, and it flourished, thanks to the fertility of its soil—to which Strabo alludes—and to its location on the main roads from Pergamon and Sardis to Laodikeia and southern Asia Minor.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Strabo adds that the constant tremors frequently caused cracking in the walls of houses of the city. As a result many of the inhabitants preferred to live in the country, outside the city walls.</p>
               <p>The founder of Philadelpheia, according to Stephanos (s.v. no. 1), was Attalos II Philadelphos (159-138 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ).<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The presence of the Macedonian shield on coins of the town indicates that Macedonians were among the earliest settlers and hence that it originated as a military colony.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> An honorific inscription, most likely dating to the period soon after the colony's founding, was voted by <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00300.gif"/>. From the mention of <hi rend="italic"> politai</hi> and ephebes we may conclude that even at this early stage in its development Philadelpheia had the accessories of a polis.

               <p>1. Jones claimed that Philadelpheia was a refoundation of the old Lydian town of Kallatebos (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 54) and that the organization of Philadelpheia by guilds in the Imperial period originated in the Lydian (i.e., pre-Greek) town (see also Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 105-6). However, the site of Kallatebos is not definitely known (Magie, 799; see also G. Radet, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 15 [1891] 373-80; Bürchner, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Kallatebos"). Broughton has correctly pointed out that the evidence for a guild organization, being from the Imperial period, is so late as to render Jones's suggestions questionable (<hi rend="italic">AJP</hi> 62 [1941] 106). Seven tribes are attested from the Imperial period at Philadelpheia (<hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> IV.1632 and LW III.656); these apparently also functioned as guilds. Their precise nature, however, remains unclear (see N. Jones, <hi rend="italic">Public Organization</hi> , 358; Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 1008; Jones, <hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 38, 54; Ramsay, op. cit.).</p>
               <p>An inscription from Philadelpheia, dated to 85/6 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> , refers to <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00301.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00302.gif"/> (KP III.20). It is not clear, however, whether this refers to a settlement that preceded the Attalid colony or to an abandoned section of the city (see comments of Keil and von Premerstein, loc. cit.). Cf. the <hi rend="italic">palaia polis</hi> at KOLOPHON; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> (1936) 158 n. 6.</p>
               <p>2. Regarding the <hi rend="bold">founder of Philadelpheia</hi> , J. and L. Robert mention an inscription of Imperial date in the Manisa museum that refers to "King Attalos." They suggest this may have been the base of a statue set up in honor of the city's founder (<hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1958] 436; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> [1976] 186). Joannes Lydos (<hi rend="italic">De mensibus</hi> , ed. R. Wuensch, p. 113.5-6) was certainly incorrect in claiming the city was an Egyptian foundation. Undoubtedly he (or his source) was misled by the name and assumed the town had been founded by Ptolemy Philadelphos.</p>
               <p>3. For the <hi rend="bold">Macedonian shield</hi> on the coins of Philadelpheia see, for example, <hi rend="italic">Inv.

Head is inclined to date these and certain other coins (cf. <hi rend="italic">BMC Lydia</hi> , 187-89, nos. 1-23; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [von A] 3057-61; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [Cop] <hi rend="italic">Lydia</hi> 337-51) to the second and first centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (see also L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Coll. Froehner</hi> , p. 73, and <hi rend="italic">AC</hi> [1935] 163). If this dating is correct, as is likely, it would mean that Philadelpheia developed very early into a polis. Imhoof-Blumer, on the other hand, claims that no coins were minted before Augustus (<hi rend="italic">Lyd. Stadt</hi> ., 113). Cf. the Macedonian shield on coins of APOLLONIS and MYLASA. A coin of the late first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> reads <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00303.gif"/> on the reverse (<hi rend="italic">BMC Lydia</hi> , 198 no. 64).

With regard to Sardis, the conciliatory nature of Antiochos and Laodike's actions renders it unlikely that the synoecism also involved the imposition of a foreign colony.</p>

               <p>Stratonikeia on the Lydian-Mysian border has suffered neglect at the expense of the more famous like-named city in Caria. It is nowhere specifically mentioned in the ancient literature. It does appear, however, in Byzantine sources: Stephanos (s.v. "Stratonikeia") confused it with the Carian city.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> On the other hand, the Council of Ephesos records a Lydian Stratonikeia, and the <hi rend="italic">Notitiae</hi> distinguish it from the Carian settlement.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Epigraphic and numismatic evidence from the second and first centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> confirm that the name of the foundation was Stratonikeia and that the inhabitants were identified as "Stratonikeians of Indeipedion." Around this time a town of the Indeipediatai existed as a separate entity. Under Trajan the two cities were connected in a sympolity, as is evidenced by their jointly issuing coinage.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> In 123 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> the two cities were absorbed into Hadrian's new foundation of Stratonikeia-Hadrianopolis.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Stratonikeia was probably founded by Antiochos I and named for his wife, Stratonike. Later it fell under the control of Aristonikos, who minted cistophori there.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> Aristonikos was subsequently besieged and captured by the Romans at Stratonikeia.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> Epigraphic evidence for the existence of a <hi rend="italic">prytanis</hi> , gymnasiarch, ephebarch, secretary of the ephebes, and lists of ephebes from the late second or early first century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> shows that at the time Stratonikeia was still a polis.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> After this, however, we have no more evidence from it until Roman times. The Roman coinage extended from Trajan to Gallienus.</p>
               <p>The general location of the town is indicated by a coin of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> of Stratonikeia with a river god and the legend KAIKO<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> Discoveries in the nineteenth century by Earinos and Radet of pieces of columns and of inscriptions of Hadrianopolis-Stratonikeia at a site between the villages of Siledik and Yagmurlu (approximately fifty-two kilometers east of Bergama and eighteen kilometers northeast of Kirkagaç) have fixed the site of Stratonikeia.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>

               <p>1. Tscherikower groups this Stratonikeia with cities in Mysia (20-21). In fact, early references to Stratonikeia do not indicate where it was located, or confuse it with the Carian city, while later references (fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> and later) place it in Lydia (see below). As a result Robert refers to it as Stratonikeia on the Kaikos (<hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 43 and n. 1; cf. also Robert, <hi rend="italic"> BCH</hi> 102 [1978] 437 n. 2). Eutropius (4.20.2) and Orosius (5-10.4-5) both mention the capture of Aristonikos by the Romans at a city called Stratonikeia (not otherwise specified, though it was undoubtedly the one in Lydia; see below). On the confusion in Stephanos see Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">AJA</hi> 2(1886) 22; Robert, <hi rend="bold">

The following coins and inscription of Stratonikeia in Lydia are incorrectly ascribed to the Carian city: Mionnet, 3: 378, nos. 437-39 and Suppl. 6: nos. 486-87, 496, 502, 504-6; Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">M.

               <p>In an interesting and challenging article K.J. Rigsby has suggested (<hi rend="italic">TAPA</hi> 118 [1988] 130-37) that <hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 338, which was found at PERGAMON, was not, as usually accepted, a decree of that city. He believes that the stone was a "pierre errante" that was removed from another city and brought to Pergamon during the Imperial period or later. Briefly, Rigsby's main argument (131-34) for removing the decree from Pergamon is that the dating formula—by a priest alone—is not found in any other Pergamene document. Contra, P. Gauthier (<hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1989] 279; see also <hi rend="italic">SEG</hi> XXXVIII.1263, 1266), who argues that eponymous priests are in fact found at Pergamon.</p>
               <p>According to Rigsby, the city whence the stone might have come was Stratonikeia in Lydia. If 1 understand him correctly, Rigsby argues that the occurrence of both "Stratonikeians" and "Stratonikeians of Indeipedion" in the extant Pergamene ephebic lists (see above) indicates "that distinct Stratoniceas are represented in the two usages of the ephebic lists" (136). Furthermore he claims that the two Stratonikeias were located close to each other. He then suggests that the town of the Indeipediatai originated as Stratonikeia of Indeipedion and "from its creation stood in sympolity with the original Stratonicea" (136). This having been said, Rigsby sensibly comments that he is arguing only a possibility and admits the fragility of his hypothesis (136).</p>
               <p>As a parallel to Stratonikeia being in the immediate vicinity of Stratonikeia of Indeipedion Rigsby cites the case of <hi rend="bold">AMYZON</hi> in Caria and Amyzon <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00310.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00311.gif"/> (<hi rend="italic">I. Priene</hi> 51.5; see J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Amyzon</hi> , 577-79). On the other hand, it is also possible that the two Stratonikeias were quite far apart. In his discussion of Stratonikeia L. Robert suggested that "of Indeipedion" served to distinguish this city from other "homonymous cities" (<hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 52-53). Presumably Robert had in mind, as Rigsby suggests (136), STRATONIKEIA in Caria. In fact we should be careful about articulating any rules or guidelines for differentiating between the occurrence of the simple ethnic for a city and the ethnic with a distinguishing element. For example, in the case of APAMEIA Kelainai the availiable evidence suggests that on documents from the city the simple ethnic was used. Only as one proceeds farther away do we find a distinguishing element (see also Habicht, <hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> 65 [1975] 81). On the other hand, in <hi rend="italic">I. Perg</hi> . 13 one finds three references to PHILETAIREIA by Ida. In one instance the town is simply called "Philetaireia"</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_235" n="235"/>
               <p>(l. 2); in two other cases (ll. 20, 55) it has the qualifying "by Ida." As far as I can see, in all three cases the references are to the same town.</p>

Likewise in the Byzantine period we find only the name "Stratonikeia"; see above, note 2.</p>
               <p>5. Two possibilities have been suggested for the <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> of Stratonikeia: Antiochos I in honor of his wife (and stepmother) or Eumenes II in honor of his wife. Discussion centers on the interpretation of a <hi rend="bold">cistophorus of Stratonikeia</hi> with the letters <hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> TPA BA <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00312.gif"/> and dated <hi rend="Symbol">D</hi> (<hi rend="italic">BMC Lydia</hi> , 284, no. 1; similar coins were issued at THYATEIRA [dated B] and APOLLONIS [dated <hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> and <hi rend="Symbol">D</hi> ]). Irnhoof-Blumer suggested that BA <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00313.gif"/> was King Eumenes II, that the years were those of an era dating from the expansion of the Attalid empire in 189 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , and that the city was named for Eumenes' wife. (Originally Imhoof-Blumer attributed all the cistophori to Thyateira; however, he later changed his view and classified coins having the legend A<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> O<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> with Apollonis, <hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> TPA with Stratonikeia, and <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00314.gif"/> with Thyateira. See <hi rend="italic">Die Münzen der Dynastie von Pergamon</hi> , AKAW [1884] 14, 28-32; <hi rend="italic">Gr. Münz</hi> ., 773-74.) L. Robert (first edition of <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi> , 48-49), on the other hand, suggested that the dates were regnal years and since Eumenes II ascended the throne in 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , the Stratonikeian coin dated to 194. Furthermore, since Eumenes was not betrothed to Stratonike until 188 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> (Livy 38.39.6; see Magie, 770-71), Robert argued that the city must have been named for Antiochos I's wife and therefore must have been founded by him (<hi rend="italic">VAM</hi> , 48-49, followed by Ruge, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> Suppl. VII: 1247; and Magie, 978). Hence Robert claimed it was a Seleucid foundation. However, in 1954 E. S. G. Robinson demonstrated that the Eumenes of the cistophori was not the Attalid king but rather his bastard son Aristonikos, i.e., Eumenes III (<hi rend="italic">NC</hi> ser. 6, vol. 14 [1954] 1-8). Thus, as Robinson pointed out (6), Stratonikeia could have been founded by Eumenes II. In the second edition of <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi> (252-57) Robert acknowledged the cogency of Robinson's numismatic arguments but pointed out correctly that this still did not exclude the possibility that Stratonikeia had been a Seleucid foundation (256). Robert noted that Stratonike was honored throughout western Asia Minor: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> STRATONIKEIA in Carla was defmitely a</p>

               <p>Seleucid settlement, <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> the Ionian League voted divine honors for Antiochos I and Stratonike (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 222.30ff. = <hi rend="italic"> I. Erythrai u. Klazomenai</hi> 504), and <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> Stratonike enjoyed divine honors at Smyrna (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 229.8-10 = <hi rend="italic">I .Mag. Sipylos 1</hi> ), where she probably also had a month named for her. (The <hi rend="italic">Hemerologium Florentinum</hi> includes "Stratonikos [Stratonikeon]" in a list of months for a calendar of Asia; see F. K. Ginzel, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der mathematischen und technologischen Chronologie</hi> [Leipzig, 1914] 3: 19; W. Kubitschek, <hi rend="italic">DAWW</hi> 57.3 [1915] 93-94, who suggested that this is a calendar of Smyrna; see also L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">REA</hi> [1936] 23-28; J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic"> BE</hi> [1973] 77. The Stratonike in question could, of course, be the wife of Eumenes II: she had a priesthood at Pergamon [<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 313 = <hi rend="italic">I. Perg</hi> . 178] and Teos [<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 309 = L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Ét. anat</hi> ., 9-20, esp. 18-19]. Nevertheless, in view of the prominence of the Seleucid queen it is more likely that she was also commemorated in the month name; see K. Scott, <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00315.gif"/> 2 [1931] 203-4; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">REA</hi> [1936] 23-25; Cadoux, <hi rend="italic"> Ancient Smyrna</hi> , 109 and n. 4. For the cult of Aphrodite Stratonikis at Smyrna [<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 228.4, 12 = <hi rend="italic">FD</hi> III.4. 153; <hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 229. 12, 70, 83; Tac. <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi> . 3.63], which was probably founded by Antiochos II, see, for example, Cadoux, <hi rend="italic"> Ancient Smyrna</hi> , 111f., 115-18; C. Habicht, <hi rend="italic">Gott</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 100-101; T. Ihnken, <hi rend="italic">I. Mag. Sipylos</hi> , 56; Klose, <hi rend="italic">Münzprägung</hi> , 24-25; C. P.

                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 100-101. On balance, therefore, although there is nothing to exclude the possibility that Eumenes II was the founder, there are positive indications supporting the choice of Antiochos I.</p>
               <p>The problem remains of determining the <hi rend="bold">beginning of the cistophoric coinage</hi> . Robinson's demonstration that the BA <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00316.gif"/> belongs to the period 132-130 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> rather than 196-186 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> undermined the arguments for dating the origins of the cistophori to the third century. In recent years arguments have been proposed for various dates in the first half of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ("discussion on the beginning of the cistophorus has produced almost as many dates as authors," K. W. Harl, <hi rend="italic">Cl. Ant</hi> . 10 [1991] 271). 1 give below a selection of opinions (for a review of the scholarship see D. Kienast, <hi rend="italic"> JNG</hi> 11 [1961] 159-88; Kleiner, <hi rend="italic">ECC</hi> , 10-16; Le Rider <hi rend="italic"> JS</hi> [1989] 164-69; R. Bauslaugh, <hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1990] 61-62).</p>
               <p>In four places Livy mentions cistophori in the loot taken by the Romans in 190, 189, and 187 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> : the triumph of M'. Acilius Glabrio over Antiochos III and the Aetolians in 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (37.46.3), the naval triumph of L. Aernilius Regillus over Antiochos in 189 (37.58.4), the triumph of L. Cornelius Scipio over Antiochos in 189 (37.59.4), and the triumph of Cn. Manlius Vulso over the Galatians in 187 (39-7.1)-At first glance this should be strong and conclusive evidence that the cistophori were already in circulation before 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> This position has been argued most recently, for example, by Allen (<hi rend="italic">Attalid Kingdom</hi> , 112-13, "before, although not long before, 188 BC") and Harl (268-94). However, the Aetolians and the Seleucids based their silver coinage on the Attic tetradrachm. Furthermore, the presence of cistophori, which did not normally circulate outside the Attalid kingdom, in the loot of triumphing Roman generals is puzzling. The Romans were, after all, allies of the Attalids. As one possibility Harl suggested (291) that the money may have</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_237" n="237"/>
               <p>come from the future Seleukos IV when he raided the Attalid kingdom in 190; i.e., he captured many cistophori that fell into Roman hands after the battle of Magnesia. This is unconvincing and in any event does not adequately explain the presence of the cistophori in <hi rend="italic">four</hi> triumphs. Alternatively, Haft suggested that it was "even more likely that the sums reported in triumphs represent(ed) payments of indemnities by cities of Asia Minor to Roman commanders." The historical problem in Livy's text has caused many scholars to dismiss his testimony as an anachronism; see, for example, R. Thomsen, <hi rend="italic">Early Roman Coinage</hi> (Copenhagen, 196) 2: 146-48. Price (<hi rend="italic">KME</hi> , 240) linked the introduction of the coinage to the events following the Peace of Apameia in 188 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and suggested that cistophori were in circulation by 180. He noted the presence of a single cistophors in a hoard that dates to 168-167 (<hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 237). The cistophorus in question belongs to series 23 of Kleiner and Noe's arrangement (<hi rend="italic">ECC</hi> , 92) and could, according to Price, date to before 180 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Bauslaugh concurred (61-64); he suggested that in the period 188-183, while the Seleucids were paying off the war indemnity to the Pergamenes (Polyb. 21.42.20; Livy 38.38.14) the latter continued to use the Attic standard. The period after this may mark, according to Bauslaugh, the beginning of the cistophoric coinage. This is certainly a reasonable hypothesis. Mørkholm argued for the first peaceful period for the Attalids after 188 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , 179-172 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , and thus opted for c. 175 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 24 [1979] 47-50); Le Rider (<hi rend="italic">JS</hi> [1989] 16-69) suggested the period between c. 185-180 and c. 175-170 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Kleiner (<hi rend="italic">ECC</hi> , 16-18; <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 25 [1980] 45-48) suggested a date around 1660 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , after the defeat of the Gauls. H. Nicolet-Pierre (<hi rend="italic">KME</hi> , 208-12, following B. V. Head, <hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1880] 145-46) proposed a still later date, c. 159 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when Attalos II came to the throne.</p>
               <p>6. Regarding <hi rend="bold">the site of Aristonikos' capture</hi> , both Eutropius (4.20.2) and Orosius (5. 10.4-5) say it was Stratonikeia without specifying whether it was the one in Caria or in Lydia. Favoring the former were among others Foucart (quoted by Radet, <hi rend="italic"> REA</hi> 6 [1904] 161), Holleaux (<hi rend="italic">Ét</hi> ., 2: 193-94), and L. Robert (<hi rend="italic">Ét. anat</hi> ., 465; the first edition of <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi> , 48). However, the full discussion by Broughton (<hi rend="italic">CPh</hi> 29 [1934] 252-54) has shown that in fact the city in Lydia was where Aristonikos was taken. This is now the generally accepted view (thus Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 157; Magie, 1042 with bibliography). In the second edition of <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi> (261; also <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 11-12 [1960] 59 n. 5) Robert changed his mind and followed Broughton; he pointed out further that the attribution of the cistophori of Stratonikeia to the fourth year of Aristonikos "settled the question."</p>
               <p>7. According to Imhoof-Blumer (<hi rend="italic">Lyd. Stadt</hi> ., 29, 36, followed by Head, <hi rend="italic">BMC Lydia</hi> , cxvi) after the capture of Aristonikos, Stratonikeia was probably reduced to the status of a village in the territory of Thyateira; it regained its independence under Trajan and was refounded by Hadrian. Jones thought it was punished for its support of Aristonikos by the confiscation of the territory of the Indeipediatai (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>

               <p>A dedication made to Apollo Tarsios by a certain Pleuratos has been found at Davala on the Hermos River. Herrmann suggested the name was Illyrian; the Roberts believed it was Macedonian. On this basis the Roberts theorized that there was a Macedonian colony at or near Tabala. Irrespective of whether Pleuratos was Illyrian or Macedonian we must await further evidence before claiming the presence of a colony in the area of Tabala. Tabala was located north of the modern Davala (which preserves the ancient name) at the present village of Burgaz.</p>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Thyateira</head>
               <p>There were various traditions in antiquity that Thyateira had once been called Semiramis, Pelopeia, and Euhippia. In fact it is doubtful if these names were ever actually used. As for the name "Thyateira" it is probably Asiatic. "Teira," which is found in other place-names, is apparently a Lydian term for "fortress" or "town." This suggests that Thyateira was an old Lydian town that predated the arrival of the Seleucids.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The colony at Thyateira was one of the oldest of the Hellenistic settlements. It was probably founded by Seleukos I in the short period between his victory</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_239" n="239"/>
               <p>over Lysimachos at Korupedion and his death (i.e., 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ). By 274 there definitely was a colony at the site: a dedication to Apollo Pityaënos dated to the thirty-seventh year of the Seleucid era survives. A number of inscriptions mention the presence of Macedonians, as does Strabo, who refers to Thyateira as a "Macedonian settlement" (13.4.4). The military organization of the colony can be seen in the dedication made to Seleukos by the "officers and soldiers" (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 211). We also have evidence for the existence of a gymnasium. The fact that in one inscription the colonists are described as "in" (<hi rend="italic">en</hi> ) and in another as "around" (<hi rend="italic">pen</hi> ) Thyateira suggests that perhaps they may have been divided into urban and rural groups.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The history of Thyateira in the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> is imperfectly known. In the early part of the century its inhabitants, if not its territory as well, suffered at the hands of the Galatians. In the inscription recording the dedication to Apollo Pityaënos of 274 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> the dedicator mentions his son who had been captured by the Galatians. The town and the surrounding region continued in Seleucid hands until c. 226 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> From c. 226 to 223 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Attalos I controlled the area. The Seleucids then regained it, only to lose it to the Attalids again in 218 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> —for how long we do not know. Attalos held the city in 201 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> when Philip V marched toward it (Polyb. 16.1.7). Once again we do not know how long after this date the city remained in Pergamene hands.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> In any event, in 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> the territory <hi rend="italic">circa Thyatiram</hi> as well as the city iself was under Seleucid control, and in that year Antiochos III encamped near the town.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> By the terms of the treaty of Apameia the town and the surrounding region were included in the newly enlarged Attalid kingdom.</p>

                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00322.gif"/> Clerc comments that the Menedemos inscription is one of the oldest from Thyateira and may date from the first successors of Alexander (398). Referring to <hi rend="italic"> BCH</hi> (1887) 466, no. 32, Radet said that on the basis of letterforms it compares with the Menedemos inscription (466). Launey thought the Menedemos inscription may date to as early as the end of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> If Launey is correct, we would have evidence for the presence of Macedonians at Thyateira sometime before the presumed founding of the colony by Seleukos 1 (<hi rend="italic">Recherches</hi> , 338). From Roman Thyateira an epitaph of Marcus son of Menophanos Lagidas survives (<hi rend="italic">KP</hi> II.79 [= <hi rend="italic">TAM</hi> V.2.1106] and the commentary of Keil and von Premerstein; see also L Robert, .<hi rend="italic">NInd</hi> ., 118).

(<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00323.gif"/>). Ed Meyer suggested the founder was Antiochos 1 (<hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi> 33 [1898] 647); Schuchhardt thought this and other colonies of the region were founded in the middle of the third century to deal with the Galatian threat (<hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 13 [1888] 9-12).

               <p>4. Livy three times (37.8.7, 37.37.6, 37.38.1) uses the expression <hi rend="bold">
                     <hi rend="italic">circa Thyatiram</hi>
                  </hi> to describe the presence of Antiochos III and his army near Thyateira. This, of course, does not prove that Antiochos actually controlled the city in 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> However, the fact that after the battle of Magnesia envoys from Thyateira surrendered the city to the Romans makes it highly probable that he did (Livy 37.44.4). For the passing of Thyateira to permanent Attalid control see Polyb.21.45.10; Livy 37.55-5; Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>

               <p>6. E. S. G. Robinson (<hi rend="italic">NC</hi> ser. 6, vol. 14 [1954] 1-8) has convincingly demonstrated that the <hi rend="bold">cistophori</hi> of Thyateira should be assigned to Aristonikos (133-130 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ; similar coins were issued at APOLLONIS and STRATONIKEIA in Lydia).

For the old view that the coins were issued early in the reign of Eumenes II (197-159 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ) and, hence, were evidence for an Attalid presence at Thyateira in the early second century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> see Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">Lyd.

               <p>7. Newell has tentatively suggested that under Antiochos Hierax there was a <hi rend="bold">royal mint</hi> at Thyateira (<hi rend="italic">WSM</hi> , 278). There is no conclusive evidence to support this hypothesis.

               <p>8. We know of a number of <hi rend="bold">villages that may have belonged to Thyateira</hi> . From the Hellenistic period there is evidence for Pityaia (KP II.19 and P. 15). Mernouphyta, which was close to Thyateira, had an Attalid colony. 1 am not aware of any evidence to indicate whether or not it was part of Thyateira. Certainly when it was founded by Attalos and Eumenes it was not (see</p>

               <p>MERNOUPHYTA).

               <p>Stephanos records a total of eighteen Alexandreias (s.v.). The tenth, called "by Latmos," was in Carla. Stephanos adds that it had a sanctuary of Adonis in which there was a statue of Aphrodite by Praxiteles. This is all that is known about Alexandreia by Latmos.</p>
               <p>Two possibilities have been proposed for the town that was subsequently renamed Alexandreia: Alinda<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> and Herakleia by Latmos.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Furthermore, four possible founders have been suggested: the Carian queen Ada, Alexander the Great, Lysimachos, and Antigonos Monophthalmos. The fact that Herakleia by Latmos was probably refounded as Pleistarcheia suggests that Alinda may have been renamed Alexandreia. According to Arrian (<hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 1.23.8), Alinda, which is where Queen Ada resided, was "a place amongst the strongest in Caria."<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> When Alexander came to Caria she met him, surrendered Alinda, and adopted Alexander as her son. Hence it is reasonable to surmise that Alinda was renamed at that time and that, in gratitude to her adopted son, Ada possibly effected this change.</p>
               <p>If Alinda did become Alexandreia by Latmos, it did not entirely lose its original name. By the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , if not earlier, the old name was in regular use.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Alinda itself has thus far yielded no inscriptions. The identification of the site (still unexcavated) at Karpuzlu is considered certain by the discovery there of Alindean coins.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. For <hi rend="bold">the identification of Alexandreia by Latmos and Alinda</hi> see, for example: Droysen, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 2: 662; L.

Droysen also bases this identification on an Alindean coin (Mionnet, Suppl. 6: 445, no. 55, Caracalla and Plautilla) that portrays a Praxitelean Aphrodite on the reverse. Berve was not inclined to accept the Alinda-Alexandreia equation (<hi rend="italic">Das Alexanderreich</hi> , 2:12 n. 1).</p>

Radet (<hi rend="italic">De Coloniis</hi> , 25), Tscherikower (28-29), Jones, and Errington (see below, note 3) suggested that the new city may have been the renamed <hi rend="bold">Herakleia by Latmos</hi> . If Herakleia was renamed Alexandreia, the new name did not last. An inscription from Herakleia dating to the early second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> records a letter sent by Zeuxis to the <hi rend="italic">boule</hi> and <hi rend="italic">demos</hi> of Herakleia (M.

               <p>Tarn describes Stephanos s.v. "Alexandreia 10" as insoluble and then hazards an untenable suggestion that someone <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have confused Herakleia in Caria with Herakleia in Media (<hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> , 2: 242).</p>

               <p>3. <hi rend="bold">Four combinations have been proposed for the founder of Alexandreia and the native city that was renamed</hi> : (1) Queen Ada renamed Alinda (Droysen, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 2: 662). Errington is uncomfortable with this possibility because it would mean that the first Alexandreia was founded not by Alexander but by a Carian queen. Furthermore Errington claims that the silence of our sources about this "perhaps argues against it" (<hi rend="italic">Alexandre le grand</hi> , Fondation Hardt Entretiens 22 [Geneva, 1976] 165-66 and n. 4). Neither of these objections is convincing. (2) Alexander renamed Alinda (Hornblower, <hi rend="italic">Mausolus</hi> , 314 and n. 156). Although various cities in Asia Minor maintained traditions that Alexander was their founder (see Appendix II), it is not likely that he actively began to establish colonies until after the battles of Issos and Gaugamela. Of course it is possible that he gave permission to Ada to rename Alinda. On Arr. <hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 123.8 see Hornblower, <hi rend="italic">Mausolus</hi> , 314 n. 152. (3) Herakleia by Latmos was renamed Pleistarcheia by Pleistarchos and then Alexandreia by Lysimachos (Jones, <hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 42, 385 n. 23; see also Hadley, <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 94 [1974] 63). Errington (162-66) objects to this because Strabo says <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00328.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00329.gif"/> (13.1.26) Errington understands this to mean that each of the Successors (except Kassandros) founded an Alexandreia (or possibly, in the case of Seleukos, an Alexandropolis) before going on to found other cities named for themselves. The Greek, however, is not so restrictive. Jones's suggestion, for which he provides no argumentation, should be considered speculative, as should Errington's hypothesis. (4) Herakleia by Latmos was first renamed Alexandreia by Antigonos Monophthalmos, and then Pleistarcheia by Pleistarchos (Errington, 166-67). Errington suggests that Pleistarchos did this essentially to spite both Alexander and Antigonos. We do know that Antigonos and Demetrios carried on extensive operations in Caria (see Billows, <hi rend="italic">Antigonos</hi> , 208-9). Nevertheless the absence of any evidence connecting Antigonos to Herakleia renders this sequence of foundirags unlikely.</p>

               <p>In a particularly confused entry ("Antiocheia 11 in Caria") Stephanos says that Antioch in Carla was founded by Antiochos son of Seleukos. If this information is correct, it can refer to either Antiochos I or III. Most probably it was the former; he was quite active founding colonies in western Asia Minor and may have founded a number of settlements in Caria as well.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Stephanos adds that the city also had a tribe named Antiochis. Undoubtedly there was a cult of Antiochos as founder of the city. The other information Stephanos gives</p>

               <p>on Antioch is unreliable. He says the city used to be called Pythopolis; but elsewhere (s.v. "Pythopolis") he says the same for Nysa. He mentions that Antioch was named in honor of Antiochos' mother, Antiochis. But Soter's mother was Apama, and the mother of Antiochos III was Laodike. Pliny says (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.108): <hi rend="italic"> Antiochia ubi fuere Symmaethos et Cranaos oppida</hi> . Undoubtedly this means Antioch was formed by a synoecism of these two villages. A bronze coin from Antioch (<hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [von A] 2421) has on the reverse the figure of a man and the inscription <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00347.gif"/>.

               </p>

               <p>If Stephanos' information that the founder of Antioch was "Antiochos son of Seleukos" is correct, this can be, as I have said, either Antiochos I or III. I believe it unlikely that it was the latter. In the aftermath of the "War of the Brothers" (c. 239-236 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), the final defeat of Antiochos Hierax, and later the revolt of Achaios (220-213) Seleucid control of Asia Minor in general and Caria in particular weakened considerably to the point where, for much of the last quarter of the third century, it was practically nonexistent. The absence of Seleucid control in Caria can be seen in the Antigonid presence in parts of Caria after 227, Attalid pressures from the north, Rhodian inroads from the south, Ptolemaic possession of various coastal cities, and the rise of an independent dynast like Olympichos (see J. Crampa, <hi rend="italic">I. Labraunda</hi> , 123-31; Schmitt, <hi rend="italic">Antiochos</hi> , 243-48; Huss, <hi rend="italic">Aussen</hi> ., 193-200). It is, of course, true that Antiochos III had contact with western and southwestern Asia Minor. After his "anabasis" to the east, Antiochos traveled to southwestern Asia Minor in 204 or 203 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ; furthermore he was in Caria in 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when he brought part of it back under Seleucid control. We also have evidence for Antiochos III maintaining contact with a number of cities in Caria: for example, Iasos (D. Levi and G. Pugliese Carratelli, <hi rend="italic">Annuario</hi> 39-40 [1961-1962] 578, no. 5 [= <hi rend="italic">I. Iasos</hi> 5]; <hi rend="italic">Annuario</hi> 45-46 [1967-1968] 445, no. 2 [= <hi rend="italic">I. Iasos</hi> 4]—a letter from Laodike to Iasos and a decree of the Iasians in response; the king and queen in the documents are Antiochos III and his wife, Laodike III; Pugliese Carratelli's identification of the queen as Laodike II was correctly challenged by the Roberts, <hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1971] 621; on the other hand, the Roberts' attempt to join this inscription to <hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 237 [incorporated into <hi rend="italic">I. Iasos</hi> 4 as lines 51-62] has been correctly challenged on epigraphic grounds by C. V. Crowther, <hi rend="italic">BICS</hi> 36 [1989] 136-38; see also <hi rend="italic"> SEG</hi> XXXIX.1110 and references cited there), Herakleia by Latmos (M. Wörrle, <hi rend="italic">Chiron</hi> 18 [1988] 421ff.), Amyzon (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 38 = J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Amyzon</hi> , 133, no. 4), SELEUKEIA Tralleis (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 41), and NYSA (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 43). Beyond Caria, we know that Antiochos HI restored SARDIS after its destruction, sent out JEWISH COLONISTS to Lydia and Phrygia, recognized the games associated with Artemis Leukophryene at Magnesia on the Maeander (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 31), bestowed various benefactions on Teos (P. Herrmann, <hi rend="italic">Anadolu</hi> 9 [1965] 29ff.), extended his control over Lycia (J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Amyzon</hi> , 154, no. 15<hi rend="superscript">B</hi> ; in general see pp. 176-191 for Seleucid administration in Asia Minor under Antiochos III), and probably founded the KARDAKON KOME there. Nevertheless, Caria at the end of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> was remote, falling away from Seleucid control and the prey of many. I do not believe, therefore, that Antiochos III founded Antioch on the Maeander.</p>

               <p>Stephanos (s.v. "Eumeneia") mentions a Eumeneia in Phrygia and a second one in Carla. And in his list of Carian cities Pliny says: <hi rend="italic">est Eumenia Cludro flumini adposita, Glaucus amnis</hi> (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.108). These references prompted scholars of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to search for and try to identify a Eumeneia in Carla. But Robert has shown that at <hi rend="italic"> NH</hi> 5.108 Pliny mistakenly inserted a group of Phrygian place-names in his list of Carian cities. Furthermore, in describing the areas traversed by the Maeander Pliny lists, in order, <hi rend="italic">Apamenam primum pervagatur regionem, mox Eumeneticam, ac deinde Hyrgaleticos campos, postremo Cariam</hi> (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5. 113). From this passage it is dear that the region of Eumeneia was in Phrygia and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in Carla. Obviously, therefore, we cannot use Pliny as evidence for the existence of a Eumeneia in Carla. As a result we are left with the doubtful authority of Stephanos as our sole evidence for a Eumeneia in Caria. And this is not sufficient.</p>
               <p>For attempts to locate Eumeneia in Caria see, for example, Droysen, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 2: 712, 720; Radet, in <hi rend="italic">Studies Ramsay</hi> , 315-21. Tscherikower has a Eumeneia in Carla, caring Stephanos and Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.108 as his authorities (31). Cf. Ruge, in <hi rend="italic">Philolog. Woch</hi> .

               <p>Stephanos (s.v. "Antiocheia 11") says that "Antiochos, son of Seleukos" founded Nysa.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> This could be either Antiochos I or III. Stephanos adds that it was</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_257" n="257"/>
               <p>named for the king's wife. But the wife of the former was Stratonike, and the wives of the latter were Laodike and Euboea. In neither case do we know of another wife named Nysa. As a result it has been suggested the city was named for an unknown member of the Seleucid family<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Stephanos also says (s.v. "Athymbra") that the original name of the town was Athymbra, named for its founder Athymbros. Strabo cites Athymbros as the <hi rend="italic">archegetes</hi> (14. 1-46). He tells us that Nysa resulted from a synoecism of three towns that were founded by three brothers, Athymbros, Athymbrados, and Hydrelos. Undoubtedly Athymbra served as the kernel for the later Nysa. The townspeople were still called Athymbrianoi in a letter sent by <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00363.gif"/>, presumably Seleukos I and Antiochos I, in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The fact that two of the city tribes were called Seleukis and Antiochis suggests the existence of a founder cult in honor of the two kings. Nevertheless given that Seleukos survived Korupedion by only six months, it is likely that Antiochos assumed the primary responsibility for building the new foundation.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Three other tribal names are known: Apollonis, Athenis, and Kaisareos.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the early second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> the city had an assembly and council and was publishing <hi rend="italic"> psephismata</hi> (<hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 64). The oldest extant contemporary evidence for the city name Nysa dates from the Roman period. The city first coined money under the Romans. Nysa is mentioned by name on cistophori dated to the period 133/2-111/0 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>

               <p>Approximately three kilometers west of Nysa was the village of Acharaka, the site of the famous temple of Pluto and Kore.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> Nysa itself was just north of the Maeander, near Sultanhisar, and thirty-two kilometers east of Aydin.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>

               <p>1. Stephanos also (s.v. "Pythopolis") claims that Nysa was originally called Pythopolis. But as he gives the same information for Antioch on the Maeander (s.v. "Antiocheia 11"), one should not rely on the accuracy of the claim. On Stephanos' errors see Mastrocinque, <hi rend="italic">La Caria</hi> , 94-96. Methodlos in the <hi rend="italic"> Etymologicum Magnum</hi> (s.v. "Akara") said that Nysa was originally called Akara.</p>

Strabo, who was educated at Nysa and presumably knew the history, does not mention a Seleucid founder: an argument <hi rend="italic">ex silentio</hi> , admittedly. Regling connected the town name with the cult of Dionysos at Nysa (in von Diest, <hi rend="italic">Nysa</hi> , 71 n. 2 92f.).</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_258" n="258"/>
               <p>3. Some coins of Nysa in the second and third centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> contain the name <hi rend="bold">Athymbros</hi> as eponymous hero of the city (Regling, in von Diest, <hi rend="italic">Nysa</hi> , 81, no. 78; 86, no. 147). The extent to which Hydrela participated in the synoecism is not clear. In any event, it was minting coins from the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> to the early third century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [von A] 3674-75; <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , lxx-lxxi and 271-72, nos. 1-4; <hi rend="italic">Inv.

               <p>Around the end of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Eupolemos besieged and captured Theangela. A fragmentary inscription containing the end of the treaty between Eupolemos and the Theangelan defenders was first published in 1931. The treaty indicates that the soldiers surrendering to Eupolemos and entering his service asked for land in a region called Pentachora (ll. 20-21). The location of Pentachora is not known. If these soldiers did receive allotments and if they actually settled on the land, they may have founded a colony; alternatively they may have settled individually around Pentachora.</p>

               <p>The circumstances surrounding the possible foundation of Philippoi are not known. Gauthier has suggested (<hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1987] 294) it might have been in connection with some benefaction the king bestowed on the city, such as increasing the territory and the population. In this connection he calls attention to a fragmentary inscription from the nearby Chalketor (G. Cousin, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 22 [1898] 376-77, no. 16) and L. Robert's comment that the king was writing to a city to which he was assigning the people of Chalketor and that the city in question must be Euromos rather than Mylasa (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 102 [1978] 517).</p>

               <p>Stephanos says that Pleistarcheia (s.v.) was a "Carian city that formerly and afterward was called Herakleia." This is the only evidence for the identification</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_262" n="262"/>
               <p>of Pleistarcheia with Herakleia. Stephanos does not specify which Carian Herakleia he has in mind, though certainly it would be "by Latmos" rather than "Salbake."<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The founder of Pleistarcheia was undoubtedly Pleistarchos the son of Antipater and the brother of Kassandros. An inscription from Tralleis records the dedication of a statue of "Pleistarchos Antipatrou." Furthermore, three inscriptions have been discovered in Carla that were dated by "Pleistarchos": at Hyllarima (year three), at the temple of Sinuri near Mylasa (year seven), and at Euromos (dating lost).<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The cumulative epigraphic evidence confirms that this Pleistarchos is the dynast rather than a local magistrate.</p>
               <p>We do not know when Pleistarcheia was founded nor in fact when Pleistarchos first gained control of part of Caria. We do know that Pleistarchos first received Cilicia after Ipsos and held it until dislodged by Demetrios Poliorketes in 299 or 298 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Plut. <hi rend="italic">Demetr</hi> . 31.4-32.3). Presumably Pleistarchos also received Caria after Ipsos. Based on the epigraphic evidence for a rule of at least seven years, we may suggest that Pleistarchos' hegemony in Caria extended from 301 until at least 295 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> It was in this period that Pleistarcheia will have been founded.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been claimed that the massive city walls were constructed by Pleistarchos, but the attribution is very uncertain. Suggestions for the builder have ranged from Mausolos in the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> to—less probably—Lysimachos in the early third.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> The site of Pleistarcheia Herakleia is at the eastern end of Lake Bafa, ten kilometers north of the village of Bafa and twenty kilometers east of Miletos.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>

               <p>1. <hi rend="bold">The identification of Pleistarcheia with Herakleia by Latmos</hi> rather than Salbake is based on at least two factors: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> The epigraphic and numismatic evidence suggests Herakleia Salbake may not have been founded until the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , long after the life of Pleistarchos (the literary evidence does not begin until the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ); this argument is obviously <hi rend="italic">ex silentio</hi> (L. and J.

                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 4.2: 318); Beloch also refers to the construction of the city walls of Herakleia by Latmos around 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> as further proof that it was refounded as Pleistarcheia.

               <p>The existence of a Ptolemais in Carl, is attested only in epigraphic evidence. The end of a decree of Laodikeia on the Lykos (<hi rend="italic">I.

               <p>Antioch were Carian cities naturally suggests that Ptolemais was as well.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Another inscription, found at Kaunos, records a dedication of a college of magistrates (<hi rend="italic">SEG</hi> XII.463, dated on palaeographical grounds to the earlier Hellenistic period).<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The persons named in the dedication were undoubtedly citizens of Kaunos, and the toponymics placed next to their names are probably to be taken as demotics of Kaunos. Two of the persons had the toponymic "Ptolemaieus" (ll. 6, 16). It is quite probable, therefore, that the Ptolemais of the Kaunian dedication is the same as that in the Laodikeian decree. In the Kaunian dedication we see Ptolemais as a deme of Kaunos, in the Laodikeian decree as an independent city. Thus we can now locate Ptolemais in the general region of Kaunos. Kaunos was located at the modern village of Dalyan.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Unfortunately we do not know the precise location of Ptolemais, nor do we know the founder.

               <p>1. The task of filling the lacuna in l. 30 of the <hi rend="bold">Laodikeian decree</hi> (<hi rend="italic">I. Mag</hi> . 59b) is a difficult one. In the first place the stone has disappeared from the Berlin museum. In addition, the reading of the first two letters is uncertain. And finally the length of the lacuna has been estimated to allow for anywhere from four to six letters (Robert, <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 7: 190 n.1). Hiller von Gaertringen's suggested restoration <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00385.gif"/> (in a note to <hi rend="italic"> I. Mag</hi> . 59b.30) is not acceptable, because the group of cities in <hi rend="italic">I. Mag</hi> . 59 is centered in Caria, not in Cilicia (Tscherikower, 29). And the length of the lacuna makes <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00386.gif"/> unlikely. Robert suggests that <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00387.gif"/> might fill the gap, and this is certainly a possibility (<hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 7: 190). The town name was normally spelled Kalynda, but the form Kalyndos is found in the Delphic <hi rend="italic"> theorodokoi</hi> list (A. Plassart, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 45 [1921] 6, col. IC[a].8), where it follows Kaunos; the two towns were, in fact, near each other. Kalynda is also mentioned, along with Ptolemais, in the <hi rend="italic">thiasos</hi> list discovered in the territory of Kaunos (<hi rend="italic">SEG</hi> XII.473, on which see below and Bean, op. cit., 25).</p>

               <p>a "Ptolemaieus" (l. 17). It is not possible to specify whether the inscription dates to before or after the sale of Kaunos to Rhodes (see below). If after, it would bear witness to the persistence of the name Ptolemais, even in the period following the departure of the Ptolemies. Furthermore, we do not know if the toponymic "Ptolemaieus" is being used to indicate a deme of Kaunos or a foreign town detached (presumably by the Rhodians) from Kaunos; see further, Bean, 24-25.</p>

               <p>According to Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.108) Tralleis was renamed Seleukeia. This is the only explicit literary attestation for the name change.</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_266" n="266"/>
               <p>Tralleis was originally founded, according to Strabo (14.1.42), by Argives and some Tralleian Thracians.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The city surrendered itself to Alexander in 334 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Arr. <hi rend="italic"> Anab</hi> . 1.18.1). In 313 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Antigonos captured it (Diod. 19.75.5). After Ipsos the city fell under the control of Lysimachos, along with the rest of western Asia Minor, and after Korupedion it passed to the Seleucids. At some point following this the city was renamed Seleukeia. We do not know precisely when this happened nor who did it.

In 212/211 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Seleukeia exchanged <hi rend="italic">isopoliteia</hi> with Miletos. The lists of new Milesian citizens from the latter part of the third century have several persons with the ethnic <hi rend="italic">Seleukeus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Seleukis</hi> .

               <p>By the latter part of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Seleukeia was receiving privileges from Antiochos III and had the accouterments of a developed polls: it passed decrees, had a <hi rend="italic">boule</hi> and assembly, as well as <hi rend="italic">strategoi, tamiai</hi> , and a secretary of the <hi rend="italic">demos</hi> .

               <p>The name Seleukeia persisted until the city passed to the Attalids following the Treaty of Apameia.

               <p>Numerous names, most of them fictitious, were attributed to Tralleis. At <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.108 Pliny gives three names for Tralleis: Seleukeia, Euantheia, and Antioch. Antioch is nowhere else attested, and in view of Tralleis' proximity to Antioch on the Maeander, it is probable that Pliny simply had confused the two. Stephanos (s.vv. "Trallis" and "Gharax") says it was called Polyantheia (ed. Meineke; the Dindorf edition has "Antheia") and Erymna (on the latter name see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>

The decree was passed in the year after Autokles, which Rehm dated to 188/7 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (p. 206). This was awkward because it meant that, contrary to what one should have expected, the toponym Seleukeia persisted after the battle of Magnesia and the arrival of the Attalids. However, M.

               <p>The toponym <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00393.gif"/> is found on the Delphic <hi rend="italic">theorodokoi</hi> list, now dated to c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (L.

The fact that the name is immediately followed by that of Magnesia on the Maeander and Priene confirms that this can only be Seleukeia Tralleis. The presence of foreign mercenaries in Tralleis is attested by a list of names of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> found on an inscription there (LW III.599 = L.

               <p>Although we can trace the relative chronological sequence in the history of Stratonikeia, it is difficult to supply firm dates.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> A Ptolemaic inscription from this area recording the sale of a vineyard and dated to the ninth year of "Ptolemy son of Ptolemy," that is, Philadelphos, shows that the region was under Ptolemaic control until at least 274 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> By 268 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> the territory had probably</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_269" n="269"/>
               <p>passed to the Seleucids. Stratonikeia was named, according to Stephanos (s.v. "Stratonikeia"), in honor of Stratonike, the wife of Antiochos. This suggests the founder was Antiochos I. Stratonikeia was one of the cities that received the Delphic <hi rend="italic"> theoroi</hi> in c. 230-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Strabo, who describes Stratonikeia as a <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00394.gif"/>, says the town was adorned with expensive buildings by "the kings" (14.2.25).<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> He does not specify who "the kings" were.</p>
               <p>Subsequently Rhodes acquired Stratonikeia through "the great favor of Antiochos and Seleukos" (Polyb. 30.31.6). The identity of Antiochos and Seleukos is a major crux.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> A possible reconstruction suggests we are dealing with Seleukos II and Antiochos III. Under this hypothesis Stratonikeia first passed to Rhodes during the reign of Seleukos II (246-226/5 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ). Around 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> it came briefly under the control of Philip V of Macedon and was retaken by Rhodes with the help of Antiochos in 197 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> (Livy 33.18.22).<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> It then remained under Rhodian control until 167, when it was declared free and independent by the Romans. It was at this time that Stratonikeia began to mint its own coinage. For the ethnic the coins normally carry the legend <hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> TPATONIKE<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N; a <hi rend="italic">senatus consultum</hi> of 81 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> refers to the citizenry as <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00395.gif"/>.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi>

               <p>Inscriptions from the Hellenistic period indicate that the city had broad avenues (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00396.gif"/>) laid out in a checkerboard pattern and mention quarters (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00397.gif"/>) that were related to the military organization of the city. For civic purposes Stratonikeia was organized into tribes and demes. The demes were the old Carian villages in the territory of Stratonikeia.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> A Macedonian month name (Loios) is found in the decree of 268 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> in honor of Nonnous (<hi rend="italic">I.

               </p>
               <p>Strabo tells us that Stratonikeia had within its territory two important temples, that of Hekate at Lagina and that of Zeus Chrysaoreus (14.2.25). A third important temple was that of Zeus Panamaros at Panamara. The temple of Zeus Chrysaoreus was the center of the Chrysaoric League.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> The earliest specific reference to this league is a decree of 267 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> engraved at Labraunda (<hi rend="italic">I.

Strabo also adds that the temple was "near" Stratonikeia (14.2.25). This is the only indication of its location; the site of the temple has not been discovered with certainty.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi>

               <p>1. The <hi rend="bold">question of the earlier name(s) of Stratonikeia</hi> is a complicated one. While Pausanias says that both the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> of Stratonikeia were originally called Chrysaoris (5.21.10), Stephanos says that Chrysaoris was the original name of the city called Idrias (s.vv. "Idrias" and "Chrysaoris"). He also quotes Epaphroditus that Chrysaoris was the name for all of Caria. And earlier Herodotus had said (5.118) that Idrias was the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> from which the Marsyas flowed; see further Oppermann, <hi rend="italic">Zeus Panamaros</hi> , 9-12; Laumonier, <hi rend="italic"> Cultes indig</hi> ., 194-95; Magie, 1032; Sahin<ref target="d0e23754" type="fnoteref">*</ref>

               <p>Stephanos also says (s.v. "Stratonikeia") that the name of the town was later changed to Hadrianopolis. This is incorrect. Stephanos has confused this Stratonikeia with the like-named town in Lydia that changed its name under Hadrian (L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>

Labraunda</hi> 43) records an honorific decree of the Chrysaoric League of 267 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> proposed by a Mylasan. The decree, which was dated to the nineteenth year of King Ptolemy, was in honor of Apollonios, the <hi rend="italic">oikonomos</hi> of King Ptolemy, and was engraved at Labraunda. This indicates that at the time Stratonikeia had not yet been established as the regular center for the League. This prompted C. Habicht to suggest (<hi rend="italic">Gnomon</hi> 44 [1972] 169 n. 1) that the region around Stratonikeia was lost by the Ptolemies after 267 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , i.e., around 259/8 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , and thus that Antiochos II might have been the founder. However, the publication in 1980 of an inscription from Yatagan, which is near the site of Stratonikeia, reopened the question of the founder (M. Ç.

The inscription, which is dated to the reign of "King Antiochos and his son Antiochos" in the forty-fourth year of the Seleucid era (268 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), records a decree in honor of Nonnous, who bore the ethnic Koliorgeus, a future deme of Stratonikeia (see below, note 7). If, as is likely, the decree was passed by Stratonikeia, this would indicate that the city had been founded by Antiochos I rather than by his son. For the <hi rend="bold"> attribution of the founding to Antiochos I</hi> rather than to Antiochos II, see J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Mélanges Lévy</hi> , 563 nn. 1 and 2. Stratonike was the wife of Antiochos I (and earlier, Seleukos) as well as the mother of Antiochos II. But Stephanos' indication that the city was named in honor of Stratonike "the wife of Antiochos" favors Antiochos I as the founder (see Fraser and Bean, <hi rend="italic">Rhodian Peraea</hi> , 102).</p>
               <p>There are two possible indications, neither convincing, that Seleukos I Nikator might have founded Stratonikeia. First, Appian (<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 57) lists a Stratonikeia among the foundations of Seleukos. But the short time that Seleukos was in western Asia Minor in the period between Korupedion and his death makes it unlikely that either Stratonikeia in Caria or Lydia were his. Appian's notice may be an error, or it may possibly refer to Stratonikeia in Mesopotamia (Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 6.118).</p>

Seleukos I did take some interest in Caria in the short time between Korupedion and his death: for example, he may have founded APOLLONIA Salbake, and he (and his son Antiochos) communicated with an official regarding the Plutonium at NYSA. It is possible, therefore, that he wrote the fragmentary letter at about the same time. The question is, to whom? Sahin<ref target="d0e23855" type="fnoteref">*</ref>

However, there is nothing to indicate whether Seleukos was writing to a city rather than to some officials (as he did in the case of Nysa, <hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 9) or a village (as Attalos III did to Hierakome, <hi rend="italic">RC</hi> 68). Hence we cannot use this document as proof that Stratonikeia was in existence at the time. Finally, is it possible that this letter was written by Seleukos II? In that regard it is well to recall that we do have a decree of APOLLONIA Salbake dated to the sixty-ninth year of the Seleucid era (242 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ) in the reign of Seleukos II (<hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> VI.154).</p>

But, as Laumonier notes, Herodotus does not indicate whether this was the sanctuary of Zeus Chrysaoreus. The fact that the earliest definite evidence for the Chrysaoric League comes from Labraunda prompted Crampa to suggest that at this time the League "as such did not yet exist" (<hi rend="italic">I.

               <p>There is no literary or epigraphic evidence that indicates Akmoneia in Phrygia was a Hellenistic foundation. Tscherikower, following an earlier suggestion of Ramsay, thought <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> that some of the coins might reflect Attalid influence or <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> that the situation of the town might remind one of Seleucid colonies. This is all quite subjective and rather weak evidence, as Tscherikower himself admitted. We should need more substantial proof before claiming that Akmoneia was a Hellenistic foundation.</p>

               <p>Radet claimed, on the basis of three factors, that Amorion in Phrygia had been a Macedonian colony: (1) the appearance of the name Alexander on coins of Amorion from the time of Augustus, (2) the discovery of an inscription near Amorion that was set up by someone named Makedon, and (3) the use of Macedonian month names at Amorion.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Regarding the first point, it is highly unlikely that the Macedonian king is meant; far more probably this Alexander was a local magistrate.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> As for the second point, the name "Makedon" used as a personal name cannot be evidence for the Macedonian origin of this individual, especially since he had a brother named Pamphilos, and both were, in turn, the sons of Pamphilos.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> And, finally, the use of Macedonian month names was widespread throughout Asia Minor and was not confined to colonies.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Therefore, based on the available evidence, we should not consider Amorion a Macedonian colony.</p>

               <p>According to Strabo (12.8.14) Antioch near Pisidia was settled by colonists from Magnesia on the Maeander.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> While the founder is not definitely known it was probably Antiochos I.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Further evidence for the relationship between the two cities may be seen in an inscription (<hi rend="italic">I.

It has been reasonably conjectured that the decree dates to around 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and that it was passed by Antioch near Pisidia. At two places in the surviving portion (79.15, 80.12) the decree refers to the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00408.gif"/> that existed between the two cities. The inscription also indicates that at this tune Antioch had a <hi rend="italic">boule, demos, strategoi</hi> , and <hi rend="italic">grammateis</hi> . It is possible that the <hi rend="italic"> vici</hi> of the later Roman colony at Antioch replaced the tribes of the Hellenistic town.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The Magnesian month name Smision is attested in <hi rend="italic">I. Mag</hi> . 81.7, which is probably an Antiochene decree. Antioch may have contained a large Thracian population. In 1922 Ramsay announced the discovery of an "inscription of pre-Roman time ... containing a list of citizens [of Antioch], all Thracians." Unfortunately the inscription was never published.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> A large statue of a seated Zeus, a type frequently found on Seleucid coins, has been found at Antioch.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> The earliest extant coinage dates from the late first century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>

               <p>Strabo says (12.3.31) that Antioch was located near the temple of Men Askaenos. The remains of the temple, which dated from Hellenistic times, have been identified at Kara Kuyu, a high peak just southeast of the city. Strabo also says there was a second temple of Men in the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> of Antioch; the remains of this have not yet been found.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>

               <p>Antioch, which was in Phrygia near Pisidia, was adjacent to the site of the modern Yalvaç. Coinage with the river god Anthios calls attention to Antioch's location on that river.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi>

               <p>8. Levick has suggested (<hi rend="italic">RCSAM</hi> , 18; see also Droysen, op. cit.) that the site of the Hellenistic colony "was probably already occupied by a temple village devoted to the Phrygian god Men and run by his priests. Presumably the land was provided at Men's expense." Following Strabo's statement that there were <hi rend="bold">two temples of Men</hi> , one near (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00414.gif"/>) Antioch and one in the <hi rend="italic"> chora</hi> of Antioch, Anderson, following a suggestion of Ramsay, hypothesized that the temple near the city was built at the time of the founding of the city, while the one farther out was pre-Hellenistic, <hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> (1913) 267-68; see also Levick, <hi rend="italic"> JHS</hi> 91 (1971) 82-83; Mitchell, <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> 33 (1983) 9 and 34 (1984) 10; Boffo, <hi rend="italic">Re ellenistici</hi> , 282-86. In a private communication Stephen Mitchell has kindly provided the following information regarding the temple at Kara Kuyu: "6 × 11 Ionic on a stepped krepis; built ?150 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ; possible Attalid patronage; some similarities in the ground plan of this and a smaller temple in the sanctuary with that of Zeus Sosipolis at Magnesia on the Maeander." Ramsay suggested (<hi rend="italic">ABSA</hi> 18 [1911-1912] 37ff., esp. 72; <hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> 8 [1918] 113) that the earlier temple was located at Sagir 21 km north of Antioch; see also Levick, <hi rend="italic">RCSAM</hi> , 44, 86-87; <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> (1971) 82-83. E. N. Lane pointed out (<hi rend="italic">CMRDM</hi> 3: 55) that Men was also worshipped at Magnesia on the Maeander. However, Lane noted that the evidence from Magnesia is late (the Severan period); furthermore each town has a peculiar iconography. As a result, he suggests the cult had an independent development in each place. Strabo gives the surname of Men as <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00415.gif"/> (12.3.31). The inscriptions, however, usually have <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00416.gif"/> (see Lane, <hi rend="italic">CMRDM</hi> , 1: 57, 69-70, for example).</p>
               <p>9. For the <hi rend="bold">location of Antioch</hi> see Levick, <hi rend="italic">RCSAM</hi> 42-43; Mersich, <hi rend="italic">TIB</hi> VII: 188; and maps at the end of both. For the <hi rend="bold">location of Antioch</hi> in the part of Phrygia that bordered on Pisidia (Strabo 12.8.13) rather than in Pisidia see Strabo who correctly writes (12.3.31 and 12.8.14) <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00417.gif"/>. Note also that Strabo, quoting Artemidorus (12.7.2), does not include Antioch among the cities of Pisidia. Cf., however, Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.94; Acts 13.14; Ael. <hi rend="italic">NA</hi> 16.7; Ptol. 5-4-9; Hierokles 672.2; Stephanos s.v. "Antiocheia 4"; <hi rend="italic">Not.

               <p>A fragmentary decree of Tralleis records various Phrygian cities that had sent messages of condolence (<hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 26 [1901] 238, no. <hi rend="italic">2 = I.

Drew-Bear suggested that if Pappakonstantinou, who originally read the inscription, had mistakenly read an alpha and an iota instead of a nu at the beginning of the line, then one could restore <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00420.gif"/> (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 114 [1990] 697 n. 66).

               <p>Strategically located at the junction of the roads that join Phrygia and Pam-phylia to Lydia and Ionia, Kelainai was already an important city under the Persians. According to Xenophon (<hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> 1.2.7-8) it was the site of a palace of Cyrus, a fortified palace of the Great King, and a large park. Not surprisingly Alexander chose it to be the capital of the satrapy of Phrygia. As such it was the residence of Antigonos Monophthalmos.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Later Antiochos I Soter moved the inhabitants of Kelainai to a nearby site in the plain in front of the Sultan Dag, close to the confluence of the Marsyas and Maeander rivers. There he founded Apameia, naming it after his Bactrian mother.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> While the new name was used on coins, official documents, and Byzantine lists, the old was not forgotten and continued to be used by poets and prose writers throughout antiquity.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The Seleucids maintained a palace at Apameia (Livy 35.15.6). From an epigram of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> we learn that a certain Gaul, Brikkon, considered Apameia to be his <hi rend="italic">patris</hi> .

               <p>The town name and the ethnic had a number of variant forms. On inscriptions from the town and nearby, as well as on coins, it is simply "Apameia" or "Apameus." Farther away, a distinguishing term was often added. Nicolaus of Damascus referred to it as "Phrygian Apameia" (in Ath. 8.332f). A list of victors from Samos mentions an <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00421.gif"/> (Michel, <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> 901.13); at Stratonikeia in Carla it is called <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00422.gif"/> (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 441.207). Strabo (12.6.4) and Ptolemy (5.2.17) referred to it as Apameia <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00423.gif"/>, and some coins from the time of Hadrian have a representation of either one, two, three, or five chests and the legend KIB<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> TOI (on coins with five chests) on the reverse.

The precise location of Kelainai vis-à-vis Apameia is not known; see Ruge and Magie; cf. Ramsay, 398, 412-13. For Kelainai under Alexander, Antigonos, and Eumenes, who wintered there in 321 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> see Magie, 983; Bosworth, <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi> ., 173 and references cited there; see also Wehrli, <hi rend="italic">Antig</hi> ., 80; Billows, <hi rend="italic">Antigonos</hi> , 296, who suggests that prior to the advent of Antiochos "the population of Kelainai already contained a large Greco-Macedonian element and that this was due to Antigonos" (cf. Tscherikower, 155-56).</p>
               <p>2. For <hi rend="bold">Antiochos I as the founder of Apameia</hi> see Strabo 12.8.15. Orth (<hi rend="italic">König. Macht</hi> ., 141 n. 11. followed by Mehl, <hi rend="italic">Seleukos Nikator</hi> , 301 n. 50) claimed Seleukos I as the founder. He referred to Livy (38.13.5) and Solinus (p. 167.8-10, ed. Mommsen, second edition). The former mentions <hi rend="italic"> novaeque urbi Apameae nomen inditum ab Apama sorore Seleuci regis</hi> . Two points: Apama was Seleukos I's wife, not his sister. It is not clear whether Livy simply erred (so Berve, <hi rend="italic">Das Alexanderreich</hi> , 2: 52 n. 2) or whether he was reflecting Seleucid and Ptolemaic usage of the term "sister" as an honorific title (so Radet, <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> [1893] 58; see also Holleaux, <hi rend="italic"> Ét</hi> ., 3: 180; Orth, <hi rend="italic">König. Macht</hi> . 72. On Apama see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 108 [1984] 467-72). Furthermore the Latin says the town was named for Apama but does not indicate who was the founder. Solinus <hi rend="italic">does</hi> specifically say that Seleukos founded Apameia. However, inasmuch as Seleukos first came into possession of Phrygia after his victory over Lysimachos at Korupedion in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (see APOLLONIA in Phrygia), it is highly unlikely that he would have had the opportunity to found Apameia. That fact and the superior authority of Strabo favor Antiochos I as the founder. (Hirschfeld, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Apameia 6," claimed Antiochos III <hi rend="italic">Soter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi> ) as the founder; this (typographical?) error for Antiochos I is perpetuated in the <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae</hi> s.v. "Apameia," 874). For the name "Apameia" on coins and official inscriptions see below. "Apameia" is also found in Hierokles (673.4) and the <hi rend="italic">Not. Ep</hi> . 1.46, 2.49, etc.</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_283" n="283"/>
               <p>3. Tscherikower (33), following Ramsay (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 430), suggested that the use of the name "Kelainai" was revived in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> In fact, as L. Robert pointed out (<hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 2 [1946] 76), the old name was continuously used in antiquity by poets and prose authors; see, for example, Livy 38.13.7; Ov. <hi rend="italic">Fast</hi> . 4.363; App. <hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 36; Paus. 10.30.9; Dio Chrys. <hi rend="italic">Or</hi> . 35; and further references in Ruge, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Kelainai." Apameian coins with representations of the hero Kelainos, Zeus Kelaineus, and Dionysos Kelaineus are quite common (e.g., <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 88ff., nos. 114, 117, 185; A. Löbbecke, <hi rend="italic">ZfN</hi> 15 [1887] 49). A metrical epitaph on a sepulchral stele from Sardis, which was dated by L. Robert, on the basis of the letterforms, to the mid-third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , refers to the town as "Kelainai" (<hi rend="italic">AJA</hi> 64 [1960] 53-56). The epitaph is for a woman, Matis; the name could be Greek or Phrygian (Robert, 55).</p>
               <p>4. The <hi rend="bold">epigram for the Gaul</hi> was originally published by G. Daux, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 92 (1968) 924, then republished with commentary by C. B. Welles, <hi rend="italic">Klio</hi> 52 (1970) 477-90 (see esp. p. 482). The appearance of the name <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00426.gif"/> prompted Welles to conclude that this was the Spartan king Areus I and, hence, the reference was to the Chremonidean War. This, of course, would have dated the epigram to the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> However, L. Robert has correctly noted that the name refers to the god Ares rather than to the Spartan king (<hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1971] 415; see also Orth, <hi rend="italic"> König. Macht</hi> ., 141 n. 11). Hence we must set aside, as Robert noted, Welles's dating of the inscription. For evidence of natives and Iranians at Apameia see Robert, op. cit., 55-56; id., <hi rend="italic">NInd</hi> ., 348ff. For corrections to <hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> VI.173 (= W. H.

               <p>5. <hi rend="bold">Cistophori</hi> with the monogram <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00427.gif"/> have generally been attributed to Apameia and dated to before 133 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> (e.g., <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 69-70, nos. 1-9; Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">Kl.M</hi> ., 205-6, nos. 1-5; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [yon A] 3448-56, 8331-34; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [Cop] <hi rend="italic">Phrygia</hi> 147-48; Kleiner, <hi rend="italic">ECC</hi> , 86-95, series 1-31); those with the legend A<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> A to after c. 90 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> (e.g., <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 70-71, nos. 10-25; <hi rend="italic"> SNG</hi> [von A] 3457-63, 8335-37; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [Cop] <hi rend="italic">Phrygia</hi> 149-57; Kleiner, <hi rend="italic">Studies Thompson</hi> , 124-29, nos. 1-41a). Furthermore a single flute appears as a symbol on some of the latest of the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00428.gif"/> reverses, while a double flute (the attribute of the Phrygian Marsyas) appears on the A<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> A coins. Kleiner argued that the coins were actually minted at Pergamon for Apameia: <hi rend="italic">ECC</hi> , 86-96; <hi rend="italic">Essays Thompson</hi> , 119-30, esp. 120-21; and <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 25 (1980) 48-52. Unhappy with the great distance between Pergamon and Apameia, Møorkholm argued against a connection between the two cities. In 1979 he revived an old hypothesis of Du Mersan (<hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1846] 7-9) that the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00429.gif"/> pieces should be attributed to Parion in the Hellespont. Claiming that—among other things—the single- and double-flute symbol are not identical, Mørkholm suggested that the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00430.gif"/> coins should be assigned to either Parion or APOLLONIA on the Rhyndakos and not to Apameia (<hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 24 [1979] 53-60, analyzed by Le Rider, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 114 [1990] 686-89). However, two recent discussions have argued convincingly against Mørkholm's suggestion and in favor of Apameia. R. Bauslaugh (<hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1990] 47 n. 12) pointed to the evidence of Strabo 13.1.14. The latter implies that Parion</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_284" n="284"/>
               <p>was not a subject city of the Attalid kingdom; this is supported by the existence of autonomous tetradrachms minted by Parion. Furthermore Bauslaugh claimed that the countermarks themselves argue against Mørkholm. Hence he argued convincingly in favor of Kleiner's attribution. Finally Le Rider has added further strong support in favor of the attribution of these cistophori to Apameia (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 115 [1991] 363-65). He pointed out that the monograms found on a number of cistophori normally contain at least the first three letters of the city's name. In the case of the monogram <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00431.gif"/> this would exclude Parion (the rho is lacking) and Apollonia (the omicron is lacking) but would allow for the attribution to Apameia.</p>
               <p>A bronze coin of Apameia is variously dated to "circ. 190(?)" by Head (<hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 74, no. 32), the "early second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (?)" in <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (Cop) <hi rend="italic"> Phrygia</hi> 160, and "before the time of Augustus or at the beginning" of his reign by Imhoof-Blumer (<hi rend="italic">Kl.M</hi> ., 208, no. 8a). For the coinage of Roman Apameia (ethnic: A<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> AME<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N) see, for example, <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , xxxvff. and 88ff.</p>
               <p>6. On the <hi rend="bold">ethnic of the city</hi> see especially Habicht, <hi rend="italic"> JRS</hi> 65 (1975) 81 and references cited there. For <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00432.gif"/>

               <p>Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> . 5.106) claimed that the town was first called Kelainai, then Kibotos, and, later, Apameia. But it is hardly likely, as Habicht says (81), that Kibotos was ever the actual name of the town. For coins with chests on the reverse see, for example, Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">Kl.M</hi> ., 211-12, nos. 19-20; <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 96, nos. 155-58; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (Cop) <hi rend="italic">Phrygia</hi> 211-12; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (von A) 3492-93; Trebilco, 90-91. For Apameia in the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list see Habicht, p. 65, col. II.18.</p>
               <p>7. For a review of the various attempts to explain the term "kibotos" see Habicht, 81; Magie, 983-84 and references cited there. Briefly, Hirschfeld noted (<hi rend="italic">AKAW</hi> [1875] 15) that since merchandise arrived at Apameia in chests, the surname "Kibotos" reflected the city's commercial importance. As regards the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00433.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00434.gif"/> in the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list, Habicht remarked that "wherever an ethnic is made more precise by the addition of a phrase constructed with <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00435.gif"/>, geographical names always seem to follow: regions, place-names, mountains, etc." (81). Habicht admitted to being unable to offer a satisfactory solution to the problem. He did, however, quote a letter from C. P. Jones, who wrote: "It would seem to imply that <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00436.gif"/> was some place in the region.... I wonder if the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00437.gif"/> could be the acropolis on which the old Kelainai stood, which on Hirschfeld's drawings looks rather like a chest" (81 n. 146). Far less likely is Ramsay's suggestion (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 669-72, followed by Tscherikower, 32) that as a result of a local flood legend (Plut. <hi rend="italic">Parallela Graeca et Romana</hi> 5 [306E-307A]; Trebilco, 89-90) the Jewish community of Apameia designated one of the local mountains as the resting place of the ark and furthermore influenced the choice of "Kibotos" for Apameia. Among other things, the appearance of two, three, and five <hi rend="italic">kibotoi</hi> (rather than just one) on certain Apameian coins (see above, note 6) undercuts this hypothesis (see Magie,</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_285" n="285"/>
               <p>984). For Apameian coins of the end of the second century/first half of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> showing a man and a woman both inside and beside an ark (shaped like a rectangular box) and the explanatory name Nile see, for example, <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 101, no. 182; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (von A) 3506, 3513 (= Y.

               <p>According to Stephanos, Apollonia was the refounding of an older town called Mordiaion.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The circumstances of the Hellenistic refounding are not dearly known. Some scholars, pointing especially to the name, suggest it was an Attalid colony. The toponym "Apollonia," however, does not of itself prove an Attalid connection.

Who these were and how they reached Apollonia is not entirely dear. The Lycians and the Thracians were probably settled in the Hellenistic period.

               <p>1. Under "Apollonia 17" Stephanos gives <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00443.gif"/>, while under "Apollonia 18" he gives <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00444.gif"/>; both probably refer to the same place. Athenaeus (3.81a) says Apollonia was also called Mordion. Strabo twice (12.6.4 and 12.8.13) calls the city Apollonias.</p>
               <p>2. For <hi rend="bold">the suggestion that Apollonia was an Attalid foundation</hi> named in honor of Apollonis, the mother of Eumenes II, see, for example, Hirschfeld, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Apollonia 21"; cf. J. and L. Robert, however, who have correctly noted that a settlement named for Apollonis probably would have been called that (so APOLLONIS in Lydia) rather than Apollonia; see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic"> REA</hi> 36 (1934) 525-26; J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">La Carie</hi> , 2:239 and n. 2. Hence, based on the toponym alone, we should not consider Apollonia an Attalid settlement. For <hi rend="bold">the inscription recording a cult of Nikator</hi> see <hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> IV.226 (<hi rend="italic">=SEG</hi> VI.592 = W. M. Ramsay; <hi rend="italic">Klio</hi> 23 [1930] 243-44). There are a number of problems regarding this inscription. The stone was found at Büyükkabaca near the ancient Tymandos, which was four hours east of Apollonia; hence the stone may come from either town (<hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> IV, p. xiii). Furthermore, in the lack of other evidence the dedication does not prove Seleukos was the founder (see Habicht, <hi rend="italic">Gott</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 105; also Magie, 1315; Bickerman, <hi rend="italic">IS</hi> , 244 n. 1.

Finally, Seleukos first came into possession of this region after defeating Lysimachos at Korupedion in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">nota bene</hi> that Appian's remark [<hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 55] that Seleukos received Phrygia in the partition after the battle of Ipsos is incorrect; see Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 28; Mehl, <hi rend="italic"> Seleukos Nikator</hi> , 212-14). It is unlikely that he had the opportunity to found a settlement here in the months between Korupedion and his death. Of course this does not exclude the possibility that one of his successors, perhaps Antiochos I or II, founded Apollonia. But this is speculation.

Bieber ("The Portraits of Alexander the Great," <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</hi> 93.5 [1949] 426) assigned them to the reign of Elagabalus, while E Rebuffat (<hi rend="italic">RN</hi> [1986] 65-71) preferred a date around 202 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> , when Septimius Severus was returning with Caracalla from Antioch to Rome. For the "Alexandrolatry" of the Severi see C. Edson, <hi rend="italic"> CPh</hi> 53 (1958) 62 n. 8; A. Johnston, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> . 32 (1983) 68 n. 35; OTROUS and THESSALONIKE.</p>
               <p>Two identical inscriptions that probably postdate the Decree of Caracalla refer to a <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00445.gif"/> (J. G. C. Anderson, <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 18 [1898] 98, no. 39). Anderson believed the Benetoi might be the "'Blue Faction', not a tribe called by the Thrako-Illyrian name Benetoi, though the latter would be quite suitable." In fact the precise nature of this <hi rend="italic"> phyle</hi> remains unclear (see N. Jones, <hi rend="italic">Public Organization</hi> , 368).</p>
               <p>3. The evidence for <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00446.gif"/> at Apollonia is both epigraphic and numismatic. An inscription dated to the year 143 of an unknown era records a bequest made <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00447.gif"/>

In fact Ramsay said the list was a "list of citizens, all Thracians" from Antioch near Pisidia. In any event the inscription was never published (see L.

               <pb id="JD_Page_288" n="288"/>
               <p>Theories regarding the origin of the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00455.gif"/> abound, and certainty is not attainable (in general see Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 1315; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">NInd</hi> ., 357 and n. 2). Over a century ago Waddington (in LW commentary to III.1195 and <hi rend="italic">RN</hi> [1853] 179) called attention to Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5-95), who described the <hi rend="italic">Milyae</hi> as <hi rend="italic"> Thracum suboles</hi> . Now Milyas is the name of a region of southern Asia Minor. There was little agreement in antiquity as to its precise boundaries. In any event, Herodotus said (1.173; see also Strabo 12.8.5) that it was the original name of the area called Lycia. However, by late Hellenistic and Roman times it apparently designated a region northwest of Pamphylia, bounded roughly by Termessos on the south and the Pisidian frontier on the north (Strabo 13.4.17; for the <hi rend="italic">testimonia</hi> beating on Milyas and a full discussion see A. S. Hall, <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> 36 [1986] 137-52; and earlier, Bosworth, <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi> ., 157-58; Walbank, <hi rend="italic"> Comment</hi> ., 1: 598; and esp. Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 761-62). Waddington also called attention to the fact that Alexander used Thracians as guides when, having left Phaselis, he sent part of his army through the mountains to Perge (Arr. <hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 1.26.1). Waddington thus suggested that the colonists at Apollonia were Milyadeis and that they wanted to recall their heritage on coins and inscriptions, just as, for example, the inhabitants of SYNNADA advertised their Ionian and Dorian heritage. Anderson (<hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> [1898] 96) thought that Apollonia may have been a Seleucid foundation info which the Attalids later introduced Thracian colonists; admitting the difficulty of understanding the term <hi rend="italic"> kolones</hi> , he hypothesized that it might have been "adopted in a spirit of rivalry with the Augustan <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00456.gif"/>, such as Antioch." Ramsay suggested (<hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> 12 [1922] 184 and <hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 400) that the Seleucids settled the Thracians and that as a countermeasure to these the Lycians were brought in possibly by the Attalids. Jones (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 411) believed that the use of the term <hi rend="italic">kolones</hi> indicated the Lycians and Thracians were settled at Apollonia by the Roman government and that the settlers were possibly veterans of Amyntas' army. Calder (<hi rend="italic">AS</hi> 6 [1956] 51) thought that the Thracians and Lycians were settled in Seleucid times and that <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00457.gif"/> was simply a translation of <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00458.gif"/>. Finally, Stephen Mitchell pointed out that all the epigraphic and numismatic references except one read <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00459.gif"/> (<hi rend="italic">Proc. X Int. Cong. Cl. Arch</hi> ., 1: 314-18). The exception is Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 172: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00460.gif"/>. Mitchell suggested that <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00461.gif"/> is a misreading and that rather than translating "of the Apollonians and the Lycian and Thracian colonists" one should translate "of the Apollonians, the Lycians, the Thracians and the colonists." This reading would have reinforced a previous suggestion made by J. and L. Robert (<hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1958] 467; contra, Levick, <hi rend="italic">RCSAM</hi> , 17 n. 6) that along with the Lycians and Thracians there was another category of colonists. However, Ramsay's reading of <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00462.gif"/> was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an error. In 1987 T. Drew-Bear republished <hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 172 (<hi rend="italic">Un castellum romain près d'Apamée de Phrygie</hi> [Vienna, 1987] 16, no. 1); his text confirmed the presence of a <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00463.gif"/>. Despite this, the Roberts' suggestion has merit, and we should consider the possibility, as Mitchell speculated, that the <hi rend="italic">kolones</hi> were Roman colonists. With the division of the population at Apollonia suggested by Mitchell</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_289" n="289"/>
               <p>we may compare the evidence from a recently published inscription. Fragments of this were found at the villages of Kozluca and Bogaziçi, approximately 30 km southwest of Burdur in the region of ancient Milyas (Hall, <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> [1986] 139). The inscription, which is dated to 5/4 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , records a dedication made jointly by three groups: the Milyadeis, Roman <hi rend="italic">negotiatores</hi> (or <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00464.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00465.gif"/>), and Thracians (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00466.gif"/>). We thus have epigraphic evidence for Thracians in Pisidia that is possibly a century earlier than the epigraphic and numismatic evidence at Apollonia and NEAPOLIS. Like the Thrakes at Apollonia, the "Thracians living among them" were probably descended from the Hellenistic colonists. It is not clear, incidentally, whether they were originally settled in colonies and later dispersed or whether they were originally settled throughout the area.</p>

Münz. Mysiens</hi> 202 [= <hi rend="italic">Inv. Wadd</hi> . 642] and 203) and APOLLONIA Salbake (Hirsch, <hi rend="italic">Cat. Consul Weber</hi> 3106) see the important discussion in J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">La Carie</hi> , 2: 258-59; von Aulock, <hi rend="italic">MSPisid</hi> ., 2: 52, nos. 1-8. For the coinage of the Imperial period see von Aulock, <hi rend="italic">MSPisid</hi> ., 2: 52-63. For two coin types of Apollonia in Phrygia under Tiberius previously attributed to Apollonia Salbake see M. Grant, <hi rend="italic">NC</hi> (1949) 150-56. For coins of Apollonia with the Maeander symbol, which Waddington had attributed to the Phrygian city (<hi rend="italic">RN</hi> [1853] 180) but which in fact belong to APOLLONIA on the Maeander, see the latter entry.</p>
               <p>5. The first appearance of the name <hi rend="bold">Sozopolis</hi> is in 381 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> at the Council of Constantinople (Mansi, <hi rend="italic">Sac. Concil</hi> ., 3: 570). See also, for example, Hierokles 673.1 and <hi rend="italic">Not. Ep</hi> . 1.373, 2.438, etc. For Sozopolis see G. Hirschfeld, <hi rend="italic">Monatsbenchte</hi> (1879) 318; Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 400-401; Ruge, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Sozo(u)polis 1." It is probable that Sozopolis was not just a simple renaming of Apollonia but was in fact a different place; see Ramsay, op. cit.; Ruge, op. cit., who also suggests that Stephanos' "Sozousai" is probably Sozopolis. Note that Apollonia in Thrace also had the name Sozopolis from the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"> A.D.</hi> (Oberhummer, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Sozopolis 2"; Ramsay, <hi rend="italic"> JRS</hi> 12 [1922] 185), and in Cyrenaica, Apollonia became Sozousa.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi rend="italic">Tabula Peutingeriana</hi> (IX.2) places Apollonia between Apameia and Antioch. Stephanos records Apollonia 17 as being in Pisidia and Apollonia 18 as being in Phrygia. As mentioned above, both probably refer to the same Apollonia that was, like ANTIOCH near Pisidia, in the frontier region of Phrygia that bordered on Pisidia. Strabo (12.6.4 and 12.8.13) places Apollonia in Phrygia; cf. Ptol. 5-4-9: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00467.gif"/>. Hierokles (673.1) and the <hi rend="italic"> Not. Ep</hi> . (loc. cit.) locate it in Pisidia. Note that Hirschfeld, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Appollonia 21," places the town in Phrygia, while Ruge, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Sozo(u)polis," reflecting Byzantine geography, puts the latter in Pisidia.</p>

               <p>7. For the <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of Apollonia see Mersich, <hi rend="italic">TIB</hi> VII: 387 and map at end. For a description of the site and territory of Apollonia see L. Robert <hi rend="italic">NInd</hi> ., 356 and references. The Hippophoras River, which is represented on some coins of Apollonia (von Aulock, <hi rend="italic">MSPisid</hi> ., 2: 55, nos. 54-56; 63, nos. 184-206; Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">RSN</hi> 23 [1923] 336-37, nos. 410-11), is the modern Uluborlu çay, which flows by the city. For photographs of Uluborlu see <hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> IV, pls. 5-7. The demonstration that Uluborlu was the site of Apollonia was made by F. V.J. Arundell in 1833 (<hi rend="italic">Discoveries in Asia Minor</hi> [London, 1834] 1; 236-45). Grainger (<hi rend="italic">Seleukos Nikator</hi> , 186), who, incidentally, believed that Seleukos founded Apollonia, pointed out that Apollonia, and APAMEIA Kelainai, ANTIOCH near Pisidia, LAODIKEIA Katakekaumene, and SELEUKEIA in Pisidia, "enclose the Pisidians in a crescent of forts" (see above, p. 57).</p>
               <p>An inscription records the reallocation of three tracts of land, previously held by the people of Timbriada, to Apollonia (Sterrett, <hi rend="italic">PAS</hi> 3 [1888] no. 548 = Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 38 [1918] 139, no. VI). The dating of the inscription is not secure; it has been variously dated to the early second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (G. Hirschfeld, <hi rend="italic">GGA</hi> [1888] 590) and the late first century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> [1918] 139ff.; Mitchell, <hi rend="italic">Proc. X Int. Cong. Cl. Arch</hi> ., 1: 317). Furthermore it is not clear that the precise location of the tracts can be fixed. Hence the inscription is not useful for determining the territorial extent of Apollonia (see also Levick, <hi rend="italic">RCSAM</hi> , 45 n. 1, discussing the boundary of ANTIOCH near Pisidia).</p>

               <p>Among the cistophoric coinage is a group (Kleiner-Noe, <hi rend="italic"> ECC</hi> , 81, ser. 7) with the legend BA <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00483.gif"/> AP, which has generally been assigned to SYNNADA and dated to the second queer of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (on the dang see SYNNADA). Le Rider has recently speculated that the letters BA are in fact a monogram, <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00484.gif"/>, of Blaundos and that the letters <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00485.gif"/> AP along with <hi rend="Symbol">Q</hi> , which he also reads on the coin, refer to "trois monétaires" (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 114 [1990] 691-98). Thus he assigns this coinage to Blaundos. Le Rider's suggestion is clever and attractive, especially when combined with his hypothesis that the nearby DIONYSOPOLIS also minted cistophori in the mid-second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Nevetheless there is a problem with this interpretation: it would appear to be anachronistic that the cistophori, which predate 133 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , have the spelling <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00486.gif"/> rather than <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00487.gif"/> as we might expect. However, Le Rider quotes Drew-Bear, who remarks that inasmuch as the two forms of the toponym—with the beta and the mu—coexisted in the second/third century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> , it is quite conceivable that a similar situation existed in the Hellenistic period; see also Drew-Bear, <hi rend="italic">NIP</hi> , 92-93, no. 27, and commentary, 56-59.</p>

               <p>3. There is <hi rend="bold">no agreement as to whether Blaundos was in Lydia</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Phrygia</hi> (see Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 570). The Flavian <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list has Blaundos in the district of Sardis (<hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> 65 [1975] 65, col. I.27). And in the Byzantine period it was normally included in Lydia. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Not. Ep</hi> . locate it there (2.182: "Balandos"; 1.162, 3.218, 4.172, etc.: "Blandos"). On the other hand, the Tralleis inscription groups it with Phrygian cities. And Ptolemy lists it among the cities of Phrygia (5.2.17: "Bleandros").

               <p>There is no conclusive proof to show that Brouzos was a Hellenistic colony. The suggestion that it was has been based on either of two arguments. In 1861 C. Cavedoni said that the inscription <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00488.gif"/> on a coin of Brouzos showed that the inhabitants were colonists from Brousis in Macedonia.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> This reading is unlikely. On coins Brouzos was written with a Z not with a <hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> .

He provides no evidence for this claim. Contra, Imhoof-Blumer (<hi rend="italic">Kl.M</hi> ., 216, note to no. 4), who points to the cult of Poseidon as earthshaker at Apameia, Ankyra, and Eukarpeia and suggests we should interpret Poseidon on the Brouzos coin likewise as earthshaker rather than as the leader of colonists.</p>

               <p>5. For the <hi rend="bold">inscription honoring Septimius Severus</hi> see <hi rend="italic"> IGR</hi> IV.681. Ptolemy places Drouzon (probably Brouzos) after Eumeneia (5.2.17).

In the <hi rend="italic"> Notitiae Episcopatuum</hi> , which are in hierarchic rather than geographic order (see above, pp. 7f.), the list reads Eukarpeia, Lysias, Augustopolis, Brouzos, Otrous, Lykaones, Stektorion (1.346: Brozos; cf. 2.410, 3.436, 4.363, 7.423, 9.305, 10.359, 13.366 [Bryzos]).</p>
               <p>Although it was a member of the "Phrygian Pentapolis," Brouzos does not appear along with Eukarpeia, Hierapolis, Stektorion, and Otrous in the list of cities in the Flavian <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list from Ephesos. The reason is not dear. It may be because it was not yet a city in the Flavian period (Habicht, <hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> 65 [1975] 81 and 87). But inasmuch as the inscription breaks off after Stektorion (col. II.39), it is possible that Brouzos was mentioned in the part now lost.</p>

               <p>Stephanos (s.v. "Dionysoupolis") says that Dionysopolis was a foundation of Attalos and Eumenes, who, according to legend, had discovered a wooden statue of Dionysos at the site.

               <p>1. Radet thought that by Attalos and Eumenes Stephanos meant Attalos I and his son Eumenes II (<hi rend="italic">De Coloniis</hi> , 56), but this is unlikely. As Tscherikower noted (33; see also Robert, <hi rend="italic"> VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 260), Attalos I ruled over Phrygia for a very short time. Furthermore we know that Eumenes II acted with one of his brothers, probably Attalos II, in founding APOLLONIS in Lydia. Le Rider wondered if Eumenes and Attalos founded Dionysopolis following the defeat of the Gauls in 166 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C</hi> . in order to protect the Maeander valley (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 114 [1990] 701). This is a reasonable speculation. Ramsay suggests that Dionysopolis was founded by the Attalids to counter the Seleucid Blaundos (<hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 44 n.; cf. L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">RA</hi> [1934] 90-91). Ramsay also claimed that in 222 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> Dionysopolis celebrated the 400th anniversary of its founding (<hi rend="italic">Social Basis</hi> , 82; <hi rend="italic"> JÖAI</hi> 27 [1932] Beiblatt 250-52). Apparently his sole evidence is <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 186, no. 24. Now this coin does commemorate the 70th anniversary of the refounding by Antoninus Pius. But I am at a loss to discover the evidence for the 400th year.</p>
               <p>2. For <hi rend="bold">coinage</hi> of Dionysopolis see, for example, <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 182-87, nos. 1-27; von Aulock, <hi rend="italic">MSPhryg</hi> ., 13-17, 52ff.

Kleiner (79) dated this coinage to c. 160-150 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , Morkholm suggested c. 168-166 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 24 [1979] 52), and Le Rider (701) preferred a date after the defeat of the Gauls in 166 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>

               <pb id="JD_Page_295" n="295"/>
               <p>4. The <hi rend="bold">location of Dionysopolis</hi> has been the subject of much discussion. Ramsay originally placed it on the left (south) bank of the Maeander, near the modern Ortaköy and hence close to the sanctuary of Apollo Lairbenos. He—mistakenly—believed the city was founded on land taken from the sanctuary (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 126-31). On Apollo Lairbenos see <hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> IV, pp. xv and 95-115; Oppermann, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> Suppl. V, s.v. "Lairbenos," 521-35; Broughton, "Roman Asia," 681-82; K. M. Miller, <hi rend="italic">Numen</hi> 32 (1985) 46-70. Ramsay called attention to an inscription found near Ortaköy (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 147, no. 37 = <hi rend="italic"> IGR</hi> IV.758 = <hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> IV.277) in which the ethnic "Dionysopolitan" occurs. Nevertheless Ramsay himself was aware that the location was far from certain; he also referred to an epitaph of a native of Dionysopolis—<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 147, no. 36—from near Üçkuyu, 4 km north of Bekilli in the northeast Çal Ova on the fight bank of Maeander, and commented: "This place may contest with Orta-Keui the distinction of being the site of the city" (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 128). The editors of <hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> IV (p. xiv) placed Dionysopolis south of Ortaköy at Sazak.</p>
               <p>In <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi> (first edition, 1935) Robert argued at length—and convincingly—that Dionysopolis should be located on the fight bank of the Maeander somewhere in the region of the Çal Dag and the Çal Ova. Among other things, Robert pointed out that if one wanted to locate Dionysopolis near the temple of Apollo Lairbenos, it was paradoxical that Lairbenos does not explicitly occur in any of the coin types of Dionysopolis and that the Dionysopolitans rarely occur as worshippers at the temple of Apollo Lairbenos (137-39). He also called attention to the provenience of <hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 147, no. 37, and to an inscription of Imperial date (<hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> IV.756 = <hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> IV.315) copied at Bekilli that listed Hierapolis, Dionysopolis, Blaundos, and the Hyrgaleian plain in that order. (Ramsay later changed his mind about the location of Dionysopolis, and in <hi rend="italic">Social Basis</hi> , 80-83, which was published posthumously in 1941, he opted for a location near Bekilli.) Finally, Habicht pointed out (82) the connection between Blaundos and Dionysopolis in Cicero (<hi rend="italic">Q.Fr</hi> . 1.2.4) and called attention to an unpublished inscription found south of Sevliler in the Çal Ova that confirms "that the territories of the Hyrgaleis and of the Dionysopolitae adjoined on the northern bank of the Maeander, that is to say that Dionysopolis was in fact located in the area in which Robert had assumed it was."</p>
               <p>According to Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.106) and the Flavian <hi rend="italic"> conventus</hi> list published by Habicht (p. 65, col. II.21; see also p. 82) Dionysopolis was in the <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> of Apameia. In the <hi rend="italic">Not. Ep</hi> . (1.452, 2.521, etc.) it is located in Phrygia Capatiana.</p>

               <p>a military colony named for the official who founded it (<hi rend="italic">GBI</hi> , 11). Jones, on the other hand, pointed out that Hellenistic kings named cities only after themselves or members of the royal family and never after private individuals. Hence he suggested that Dokimos was acting as an independent dynast and that he founded Dokimeion to be the capital of his princedom (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 49; see also Leschhorn, 319). In fact, given the probable early date for the founding, it is possible that the distinction of king, prince, dynast, and agent—and the responsibilities of each—were not fully defined at the time.</p>
               <p>3. Strabo (12.8.14) describes Dokimeion as a "village" (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00499.gif"/>); see also Stephanos s.v. "Synnada" (though in the entry "Dokimeion" he describes it as polis). This reference to Dokimeion as a village is troublesome and led Tscherikower (35; see also Droysen, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 2: 711) to suggest it was an error on Strabo's part. Two points should be noted. First, in Roman times <hi rend="italic">katoikia</hi> was often used synonymously with <hi rend="italic">kome</hi> (especially with regard to native villages), occasionally even with <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> (P. Foucart <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 9 [1885] 395; V. Chapot, <hi rend="italic">La province romaine proconsulaire d'Asie</hi> [Paris, 1904] 97; Magie, 1022-26). Furthermore, Strabo's use of terms such as <hi rend="italic">katoikia, kome</hi> , and <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> is not always precise (see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic"> Ét. anat</hi> ., 191-94). Thus he (14.2.25) describes STRATONIKEIA in Caria as being a <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00500.gif"/>, though certainly in his own time it was a polis. Presumably he is reflecting in his own time on the origin of the city. Second, many Hellenistic colonies began their existence as villages (see, for example, the KARDAKON KOME in Lycia [time of Eumenes II]: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00501.gif"/> in M. Segre, <hi rend="italic">Cl. Rh</hi> . 9 [1938] 190, ll. 3-4; Cohen, <hi rend="italic">Seleucid Colonies</hi> , 83). Therefore, two possibilities emerge: (1) Dokimeion was originally a native village and not a colony and was still a village in the early first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> (Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">Social Basis</hi> , 286-87, suggested it did not become a city until c. 51 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ), or (2) Strabo is using the term retrospectively, as he probably did when he described Stratonikeia as a <hi rend="italic">katoikia</hi> .</p>

               <p>7. For the early working of the quarries see Tibullus (3.3.13-14), who mentions columns of Phrygian marble. Strabo (12.8.14) contrasts the great megaliths extracted in his own day with the small stones that were taken out "at first" (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00502.gif"/>); Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 36.102) describes the Basilica Aemilia at Rome (first built in 179 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ) as remarkable for its Phrygian (i.e., Dokimian) marble columns. H. Blümner, in <hi rend="italic"> Technologie u. Terminologie der Gewerbe u. Künste</hi> (Leipzig, 1884) 3: 53, took this passage as evidence for the use of the Phrygian marble in 179 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> The passage, however, indicates only that Pliny admired the building and its marble; it says nothing about <hi rend="italic">when</hi> the marble was first used. Since the basilica went through a number of rebuildings in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (and early first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ), it is not possible to specify whether the Phrygian marble dated from the original building or, as is certainly more likely, from one of the later restorations; see, for example, G. Fuchs, <hi rend="italic">Rom. Mitt</hi> . 63 (1956) 23-25; M. E. Blake, <hi rend="italic">Ancient Roman Construction in Italy</hi> (Washington, D.C., 1947) 59. In the restoration of 54 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> L. Aemilius Paullus reroofed the building on its old columns (<hi rend="italic">isdem antiquis columnis</hi> , Cic. <hi rend="italic">Att</hi> . 4.16.8; on this difficult passage see the commentary of Tyrrell and Purser, <hi rend="italic">The Correspondence of M. Tullius Cicero</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> [Dublin, 1906] 2: 156-57).

There is no numismatic evidence earlier than the time of Augustus.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Eukarpeia was a member of the so-called Phrygian Pentapolis (the other cities were Otrous, Hierapolis, Stektorion, and Brouzos).

As a result Drew-Bear suggested that the Alexander recorded in the inscription is the great king and that he was considered to be the founder of Eukarpeia. Three comments. <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> The provenience of the stone is not known. Ramsay says he found it "on a large basis in the cemetery at Tchor Hissar" (<hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> [1887] 478). A decade later he wrote: "When an inscr. is found standing free on an ancient site, it seems fair to conclude that it belongs to that site. Hence I cannot accept the suggestion made in <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 1893 p. 278 that this stone may have been brought from Brouzos: that is possible, but probability is against it" (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 702). Legrand and Chamonard, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> (1893) 278, erroneously state that Ramsay located Otrous at Koçhisar; in fact, as I mentioned above, Ramsay placed it at Çorhisar (for the location of Çorhisar and Koçhisar see Bede, <hi rend="italic">TIB</hi> VII: 266-27 and map at the end). <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> Drew-Bear is quite correct in noting that there is nothing to substantiate Ramay's claim that Çorhisar was the site of Otrous. <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> Drew-Bear is also undoubtedly correct in suggesting that the Alexander mentioned in the inscription is the Macedonian king rather than the Asiarch of the early third century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> (see the discussion in OTROUS).</p>

               <p>In <hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 66, Jones theorized that the "Corpeni" (Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.105) were "perhaps the tribe which occupied the district later shared between four small cities, Eucarpia, Bruzus, Hieropolis and Otrus, which all issued coins in the second and third centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> Under Augustus coins were struck with the legend 'of the Eucarpitic (district)' ... the district ... was occupied by a tribe called the Corpeni which in the course of Augustus' reign gave to its capital the name of Eucarpia, a Greek name suggested by the tribal name, and began to issue coins with the legend 'of the Eucarpitic (district)'"; note that already in <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 8 [1887] 469 Ramsay had replaced "Corpeni" in Pliny's list with the "Eucarpeni." Drew-Bear rightly rejected the etymology "Eukarpeia &lt;&lt; Corpeni" (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> [1991] 373-75). Among other things, he pointed out that the correct form of the ethnic was <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00515.gif"/> not <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00516.gif"/> (374 n. 55).</p>
               <p>Drew-Bear suggested that "Corpeni" referred to a city of the same name and not to a tribe. Taking this reconstruction one step farther Drew-Bear suggested that the homeless cistophorus with the legend KOP (Kleiner-Noe, <hi rend="italic">ECC</hi> , 100-101) belonged to the city of the Corpeni. Like Adramyttion (see R. Bauslaugh, <hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1990] 48), we then would have another example of a short-lived minting of cistophori under the Attalids, this time in Phrygia. The attribution of the KOP cistophorus to the Corpeni is possible, particularly in view of the likelihood that there were cistophori issued by a number of Phrygian cities under the Attalids. Among the cities that possibly issued cistophori were APAMEIA Kelainai, BLAUNDOS, DIONYSOPOLIS, LYSIAS, and SYNNADA. Nevertheless, the presence of a fish on the reverse is puzzling. Perhaps the reference is cultic rather than geographic.</p>

Hierokles (676.8ff.) lists it with Hierapolis, Otrous, Stektorion, Brouzos, Debalikia (location unknown; see BROUZOS, note 5), Lysias, and Synnada. The <hi rend="italic">Tab. Peut</hi> .

The origin of the "Eumeneian Achaians" is uncertain. Eumenes II made an alliance with the Achaian League and as a result received troops from it who fought with him against Antiochos III. The "Eumeneian Achaians" may have been descended from these troops or, perhaps, from others sent to Attalos II. Among the tribes of Eumeneia were two in which the Achaians may have been enrolled, Argeias and Heraïs. Hera was the great Argive goddess, and Argos was a member of the Achaian League. On the other hand, the designation "Achaioi" may simply refer to the mythological origins claimed by the Eumeneians. This ancestry claim can also be seen in the description of the city as <hi rend="italic">eugenes</hi> , a term that denoted a colony-mother city link (real or imagined) between various Hellenized cities of Asia Minor and cities of the Greek mainland.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The other attested tribal names of Eumeneia are Athenaïs, Apollonis, Demetrias, Artemeisias, and Hadrianis.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Among the festivals of the city was the Eumeneia Philadelphia, which commemorated the fraternal affection of Attalos Philadelphos and his brother, Eumenes.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> Apollo Propylaios was worshipped at Eumeneia.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> The usual ethnic was <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00518.gif"/>, but other forms are also found.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> For a short time in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> the city was renamed Fulvia in honor of the wife of Marcus Antonius.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>

The origin of the ancestors of the "Eumeneian Achaians" has been much discussed. Ramsay thought they came from Aeolic Kyme and not from the Greek mainland (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 371). Reinach objected to equating them with the descendants of soldiers provided by the Achaian League (<hi rend="italic">RA</hi> [1909] 368-69), and Jones suggested that the "Eumeneian Achaians" might have been native Phrygians who "concocted" an Achaian ancestry (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 54). In support of the notion that the designation "Achaioi" referred to the mythological origins of the Eumeneians it should be noted that the founding of the Panhellenion at Athens by Hadrian apparently spurred some cities of Asia Minor to discover relationships with cities of the Greek mainland (on the Panhellenic movement of the second century and the founding of the Panhellenion in Athens see S.

A double-axe, the symbol of Apollo Propylaios, appears in relief on all of these dedications; note, however, that Ramsay does not mention its appearance on <hi rend="italic"> CBP</hi> 196. For coins of Apollo holding the double-axe see, for example, <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 217ff., nos. 41-43, 47-49; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (Cop) <hi rend="italic">Phrygia</hi> 394; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (von A) 3590-91. Ramsay thought that Apollo Propylaios was the Greek equivalent of the native Men Askaenos, whose presence in the region of Eumeneia is attested (<hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> IV.739 = Lane, <hi rend="italic">CMRDM</hi> , 1, no. 101) and who also had a double-axe as his symbol (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> 356). But in <hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> IV.739 Men Askaenos is listed along with a whole series of other gods. In addition, the double axe was a symbol used by many local divinities in Asia Minor (see Drew-Bear, in <hi rend="italic">GRBS</hi> [1976] 261 and notes; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 3 [1946] 61; for the rider god with the double-axe see <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 218ff., nos. 50-51, 59; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [Cop] <hi rend="italic">Phrygia</hi> 396-97; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [von A] 3595, 3597). Ramsay also suggests that the sanctuary of Men Askaenos was at Attanassos near Eumeneia and that Eumeneia was founded on land that had been the property of the Phrygian god (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 355 and 241-43). However, the location of Attanassos (see, for example, <hi rend="italic">Not. Ep</hi> . 1.328, 2.391, etc.) is not known. Furthermore, the theory that Hellenistic (including Attalid) kings seized temple lands for their colonies is problematic (see, for example, Broughton, in "Roman Asia," 643-44; id., <hi rend="italic">Studies Johnson</hi> , 242-43 and n. 25; in general see Magie, 1017).

               <p>1. For the <hi rend="bold">literary testimonia</hi> see Ritti, 3-42. For <hi rend="bold"> the suggestion that Hierapolis was an old Phrygian holy center</hi> see Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 85ff. Magic (987) believed it was sacred to the Great Mother. Stephanos (s.v. "Hierapolis") claimed that the town name originated from the many temples there. Bean referred to a suggestion that the city was named by the Attalids (who he believed had founded it) in honor of Hiero or Hiera, the wife of Telephos, the mythical ancestor of the Pergamenes (<hi rend="italic">TBM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 201).</p>
               <p>2. Magie denied that the appearance of "<hi rend="bold">Macedonians</hi> " in inscriptions of Imperial times could be used as evidence that Hierapolis had been a Seleucid military colony (988; contra, Hermann and Swoboda, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Staatsaltertümer</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">6</hi> , 200, n. 13); note, however, that Magie also believed (128) that it might have been the Attalids who refounded Hierapolis. On the likelihood that Macedonian colonies were generally founded by the Seleucids rather than the Attalids see NAKRASON.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi rend="bold">inscriptions with the tribal names</hi> were found on the edges of the scats of the theater of Hierapolis; see Kolb, <hi rend="italic"> ZPE</hi> (1974) 255-70, pl. VIII; Ritti, 118-22, pls. 18-20. The tribes Seleukis, Antiochis, and Laodikis obviously were in honor of the Seleucids, while Eumenis and Attalis paid tribute to the Pergamenes. Stratonikis could have been named either for Demetrios Poliorketes' daughter, who was the wife of Seleukos I and Antiochos I, or for the daughter of Ariarathes IV, who married both Eumenes II and Attalos II. J. and L. Robert prefer the first identification (<hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1976] 668). For the identification of the tribe Apollonias with Apollo Archegetes rather than with Queen Apollonis, the wife of Attalos I, see Kolb, 262-64. The publication of these inscriptions firmly lays to rest the controversy as to whether Hierapolis was a Seleucid or Attalid foundation (for the various views on the subject see the references cited in Kolb, 255-56 and notes). The new evidence that <hi rend="bold">Hierapolis was organized into tribes</hi> also effectively refutes the suggestion of Ramsay (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 105, followed by Jones, <hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 73) that the city was divided into guilds rather than tribes. Note, however, that Ramsay's suggestion was <hi rend="italic">ex silentio</hi> : he knew about guilds but had no evidence for the existence of tribes; nor did he have any evidence that there had been a "Greek foundation in Hierapolis" (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 105-8; on the evidence for guilds at Hierapolis see Ramsay, op. cit.;Jones, <hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 395 n. 73). W. Judeich has suggested that the names Mailouis (<hi rend="italic">Alt. v. Hierapolis</hi> 70.2), Mamoles (ibid. 81.2), and Motalis (ibid. 344.1; see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 141 n. 2) found on Hierapolitan inscriptions were tribal names</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_307" n="307"/>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Alt. v. Hierapolis</hi> , 175, followed by C. Cichorius, <hi rend="italic"> Alt. v. Hierapolis</hi> , 33; see also Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 1008). In fact the discovery that the tribes at Hierapolis had dynastic names renders it unlikely that the latter three were tribal names of Hellenistic Hierapolis. L. Robert has suggested that these referred to "groupement[s] indigène[s] dans la campagne" (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 107 [1983] 511-15 and <hi rend="italic">JS</hi> [1983] 45-63). In general for the tribes see N. Jones, <hi rend="italic">Public Organization</hi> , 365-67.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Founder</hi> . Seleukos I came into control of Phrygia as a result of the battle of Korupedion in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> It is, however, unlikely that he had the opportunity to found Hierapolis in the few months that he lived after the battle. The region was then under continuous Seleucid rule only during the reigns of Antiochos I and II. After that it fell away from central Seleucid control as a result of the revolts of Hierax and Achaios. Antiochos III reasserted Seleucid rule over Phrygia after the defeat of the latter in 213 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> . Although there is evidence for Antiochos III founding Jewish colonies in Lydia and Phrygia, there is nothing to indicate that he founded any major settlements in the region. It is most likely therefore that either Antiochos I or II founded Hierapolis. Kolb notes (269) the very close proximity of Laodikeia on the Lykos, which was probably founded by Antiochos II, and suggests that Antiochos II would not have established another city so close to Laodikeia. On the other hand, Antiochos I did found, among other settlements, APAMEIA Kelainai and NYSA in Carla. This prompts Kolb to hypothesize that Antiochos I was also the founder of Hierapolis. This is speculative, as Kolb admits, but it is reasonable.</p>

               <p>There are two traditions regarding the founding of Laodikeia on the Lykos. Both traditions are recorded by Stephanos and Eustathius. The first, highly improbable, account ascribes the founding to "Antiochos son of Seleukos" and claims he named it after his sister Laodike (Stephanos s.v. "Antiocheia 11";</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_309" n="309"/>
               <p>Eust. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi> . to Dionys. Perieg. 918 [<hi rend="italic">GGM</hi> , 2: 379]). But no sister of that name is known for either Antiochos I or Antiochos III. According to the second tradition, Antiochos II founded it and named it after his wife, Laodike (Stephanos s.v. "Laodikeia 2"; Eust. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi> . 915 [<hi rend="italic">GGM</hi> , 2: 377-78]). This is quite likely, and since Antiochos divorced Laodike in 253, we may assume the colony was founded in the period 261-253 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inhabitants included Ionians.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> According to Pliny, the site had previously been occupied by a village named, successively, Diospolis and Rhoas (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.105). The former name may reflect the importance that Zeus had as the principal god of Laodikeia.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The worship of Apollo was also of importance. There was a tribe Apollonis in the city. And in the second and third centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"> A.D.</hi> the city frequently sent delegations to the oracle of Apollo at Klaros.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> At Laodikeia an annual, municipal festival, the Antiocheia, was celebrated in the similarly named month in honor of the founder of the colony.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> It was apparently the major festival of the city. A Laodikeian decree of the end of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> is dated by an eponymous priest.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> No indication is given as to which god the priest served. Most likely, however, he was a "priest of the City." It was at Laodikeia that Achaios, rebelling openly against Antiochos III, took the title "king" in 220 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Polyb. 5.57.5).</p>
               <p>By the end of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> Laodikeia had a developed civic organization as well as a gymnasium. It was passing <hi rend="italic">psephismata</hi> that, among other things, honored judges from Priene and accepted the invitation to the Leukophryena of Magnesia on the Maeander.

               <p>of Seleukos I Nikator and possibly the ancestor of the dynasty. A Delphic decree of 242 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> honors Lysias ("Lysias II") son of Philomelos ("Philomelos I") <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00546.gif"/> as <hi rend="italic"> euergetes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">proxenos</hi> (<hi rend="italic">GDI</hi> 2736=<hi rend="italic">FD</hi> III.4.156; for the date see Holleaux, <hi rend="italic">Ét</hi> ., 3: 359-60) Lysias II is probably to be identified with the Lysias who fought with Seleukos III (226-223 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> ) against Attalos I (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 272, 277) and possibly with Lysanias, who made a gift to Rhodes after the earthquake of 228 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Polyb. 5.90. 1; on the date see Berthold, <hi rend="italic">Rhodes</hi> , 92 n. 34). In the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> a Philomelos ("Philomelos II") son of Lysias ("Lysias III") made a dedication at Didyma (<hi rend="italic">I. Didyma</hi> 458). Depending upon whether we date the Didyma inscription toward the beginning or the end of the second century we can posit two reconstructions: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> if the inscription dates from the beginning of the century, then "Philomelos II" is possibly to be identified with the Philomelos ("Philomelos III") who came to the assistance of Termessos during Gn. Manlius' expedition of 189 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Polyb. 21.35.2), while "Lysias III" may probably be identical with Lysias II; <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> if the Didyma inscription dates from the latter part of the second century, then Philomelos II cannot be identical with Philomelos III, and Lysias III cannot be identified with Lysias II. The <hi rend="bold">identification of the founder(s) of the towns of Lysias and Philomelion is not certain</hi> ("L'origine de ces deux cités demeure entourée de mystère," Holleaux, <hi rend="italic"> Ét</hi> ., 3: 363). J. G. C. Anderson suggested (<hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 18 [1898] 107 and n. 1) the founder of Lysias was Lysias I, whom he identified as a "general of Seleucus Nikator in 216 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> " (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi> ). It is certainly possible that a general of Seleukos I Nikator, in that capacity, or after the latter's death, as an independent dynast, founded Lysias (and, perhaps, Philomellon as well). Cf. the situation of DOKIMEION and THEMISONION. Holleaux pointed out (362) that at the beginning of his reign Seleukos II had written to "the kings, dynasts, cities and <hi rend="italic">ethne</hi> " (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 229.11) and that these "dynasts" had acquired their independence in the first half of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Noting that the Lysias/Philomelos family was probably one such dynasty, he quite reasonably suggested that the state of which Lysias and Philomelion were the chief cities could already have been founded by the time of Seleukos III. Less likely is Leschhorn's suggestion (321) that the founders of the two cities were Lysias II/III (see option <hi rend="italic"> a</hi> above) and Philomelos II. Ramsay's suggestion (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 421 n. 4) that Lysias was a foundation of Antiochos III is unlikely. Walbank's hypothesis that Philomelion was founded by Philomelos I or II (<hi rend="italic">Comment</hi> . on Polyb. 21.35.2; see also Magic, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 1313; and Leschhorn, <hi rend="italic">Gründer</hi> , 321) ignores the possibility that it could have been founded by Lysias and named for his father.

               <p>and Ramsay (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 754-55) prefer a site between Oynigan and Anizli; contra, Belke, who suggests Yanikören (<hi rend="italic">TIB</hi> VII: 331, 415, and map at end). The ancient and Byzantine evidence provides only general indications for the location of Lysias but often associates it with cities of the Pentapolis (see Habicht, <hi rend="italic"> JRS</hi> 65 [1975] 86-87). Strabo (12.8. 13) mentions Lysias immediately after Eukarpeia; Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5. 108) lists Lysias right before Orthosia (= Otrous? see Robert, <hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 158). In Ptolemy (5.2.17) the list reads Konna (north of Afyon), Lysias, Kerkopia (unknown), Eukarpia, Prymnesia, Dokimaion, Synnada. In the <hi rend="italic">S. Abercii Vita</hi> (ed. Th. Nissen [Leipzig, 1912]) 75, Abercius of Hierapolis is described as being on a lofty mountain "opposite the city of Lysias" (on this passage see also Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 754-55). Hierokles (676.8-677.7) lists in order the five cities of the Pentapolis, two <hi rend="italic">kleroi</hi> , Debalikia (location unknown; see BROUZOS, note 5), Lysias, and Synnada. In the Flavian <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list the order is Hierapolis, Lysias, Otrous, Stektorion (Habicht, p. 65, col. II.36f.). Cf. the <hi rend="italic">Notitiae Episcopatuum</hi> , which are in hierarchic, rather than geographic, order (see above, pp. 7f.): Hierapolis, Eukarpeia, Lysias, Augustopolis, Brouzos, Otrous, Lykaones, and Stektorion (1.342, 2.406, etc.).</p>

               <p>An honorific inscription (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 238) for Menodoros of Adramyttion copied at Karahüyük in southwestern Phrygia was set up by the <hi rend="italic">phylakitai</hi> of the hyparchy around Eriza as well as by colonists living at Moxoupolis and Krithine (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00548.gif"/>

               <p>Ramsay claimed that the letterforms and the fact that Menodoros was from Adramyttion pointed to a date of the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> for the colonies.

Schulten (<hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi> 32 [1897] 531-32) suggested the settlements were Seleucid, founded by Antiochos II (see also Haussoullier, <hi rend="italic">Ét. Milet</hi> , 94; Bevan, <hi rend="italic">House of Seleucus</hi> , 1: 166: "probably Seleucid"; and <hi rend="italic">SEG</hi> XXXVIII.1168).

Bickerman hesitated (<hi rend="italic">IS</hi> , 128 n. 6: "j'admets jusqu'à nouvel ordre que le texte est de l'époque séleucide, mais sa date reste incertaine; il peut aussi bien avoir été rédigé sous les Attalides").

               <p>The only evidence that supports the suggestion that Otrous may have been a Hellenistic colony is numismatic and of Imperial date. The coinage of Otrous includes two types—a warrior (Otreus) stepping into a galley and Aeneas carrying Anchises and leading Ascanius—which clearly symbolize migration and which may recall an early phase in the history of the town.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Thus it is possible that Otrous originated as a Hellenistic colony. But more substantial evidence is needed before we can definitely make this claim. The location of Otrous is not known, though the fact that it was a member of the Phrygian Pentapolis (Eukarpeia, Hierapolis, Otrous, Stektorion, and Brouzos) helps place it in the Sandikli, plain.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At Çorhisar, which is in the Sandikli plain, an inscription, dated palaeographically to the Imperial period, has been found that read: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00551.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00552.gif"/> . It is probable that the inscription honors Alexander the Great as the founder of the city. Claims by cities, particularly under the Severi, to have been founded by Alexander the Great were relatively common. Of course the claim, first appearing so long after the career of the great king, is not sufficient evidence to posit the existence of a Macedonian colony. Furthermore we do not know from which ancient settlement the inscription came. Ramsay has suggested that Çorhisar is the ancient Otrous.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> This is, however, only a conjecture.</p>

               <p>1. For <hi rend="bold">coins (third century</hi>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps"> A.D.</hi> ) portraying the warrior on the galley and Aeneas see, for example, <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 345, nos. 12, 14; <hi rend="italic">Inv. Wadd</hi> . 6368-69, 6371; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (von A) 3905, 8430, 8431; see also F. Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">Nomisma</hi> 5 (1910) 33, no. 30. The tradition of a Phrygian migration from Europe to Asia Minor and then within Asia Minor was an old one in Greek literature. Both Herodotus (7.73) and Strabo (10.3.16), for example, mention the migration of Phrygians from Europe to Asia Minor. And in the <hi rend="italic"> Iliad</hi> (3.184-89) Priam tells Helen how he fought with the Phrygians, who were led by Otreus and Mygdon, against the Amazons; see also K. Regling, <hi rend="italic">Klio</hi> 8 (1908) 489; P. Carrington, <hi rend="italic"> AS</hi> 27 (1977) 117-26; BROUZOS and STEKTORION. Coin types of Otrous and Stektorion with <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> a figure stepping onto a galley and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> Aeneas carrying Anchises and leading Ascanius recall this tradition. B. V. Head (<hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , lxxxvi-lxxxvii), Imhoof-Blumer (<hi rend="italic">Nomisma</hi> [1910] 33-36), von Aulock (82-83), and Carrington (124) recognized the figure stepping onto the galley as Otreus, the Phrygian king, who was also considered to be the founder of Otroia in Bithynia (Strabo 12.4-7). Supporting this identification is the fact that Otreus' companion, Mygdon, was honored at the nearby Stektorion. Babeloh's suggestion (<hi rend="italic">Inv. Wadd</hi> . 6369-71, followed by Regling, 489-92) that the figure is Aeneas is less likely. According to Ramsay (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 686-89) the two coin types relate to the Hellenistic settlement at Otrous, the implication being that the settlers came partly from Europe, i.e., overseas, and partly from Bithynia. Furthermore, Ramsay suggests, Alexander the Macedonian (see below, note 3) was a descendant of one of these settlers. Regling suggests (489) that the Hellenistic settlers in Phrygia adopted the tradition of the Phrygian heroes known from the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> as their own. Finally, Carrington speculates (125) that the two coin types of Otrous represent an attempt by two <hi rend="italic">native</hi> (emphasis his) cities to advertise that they were part of the Greek world. This, of course, was a common phenomenon in Roman Imperial Asia Minor. Tscherikower (35) was undecided as to whether or not Otrous was originally a Macedonian colony. Ramsay (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 687-88) said that Otrous was an Attalid colony opposing the Seleucid Brouzos. There is no evidence for this claim.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="bold">ethnic</hi> is OTPOHN<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N. For the toponym Otrous see Ruge, 1884-85.</p>
               <p>2. <hi rend="bold">Location</hi> : Ramsay placed Otrous at Çorhisar (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 687; on Çorhisar see Belke, <hi rend="italic">TIB</hi> VII: 226-27); Radet suggested it was at Kusura (<hi rend="italic">Nouv. archiv. miss. scient</hi> . 6 [1895] 534); Legrand and Chamonard placed it near Kelenderes (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 17 [1893] 278); at Kelenderes (Kilandiras) a dedication in honor of Septimius Severus was found in which the restoration <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00553.gif"/> appears likely (<hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> IV.693). But the force of this identification is weakened by the fact that at the same place an inscription containing the name Hieropolis was also found (Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> [1882] 505); R. Kiepert could not decide whether the site was at Emirhisar, Çorhisar, Kelenderes, or, perhaps, elsewhere (<hi rend="italic">FOA</hi> VIII, p. 13a). The ancient and Byzantine</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_317" n="317"/>
               <p>evidence provides only general indications of the location of Otrous but often associates it with other cities of the Pentapolis in the Sandikli plain. Pliny probably mentions Otrous immediately after Lysias (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.108; L. Robert has shown that Pliny mistakenly inserted a series of Phrygian places in the list of Cadan towns at sec. 108 and that Orthosia in 108 is really Otrous [<hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 157-59]; the manuscripts have Othrusa or Otrusa). In Hierokles the order is Eukarpeia, Hierapolis, Otrous, Stektorion, and Brouzos (676.8-677.2); in the Flavian <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi> list from Ephesos the order is Hierapolis, Lysias, Otrous, and Stektorion (Habicht, <hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> [1975] 65, col. II.36-39). Cf. the <hi rend="italic">Notitiae Episcopatuum</hi> , which are in hierarchic, rather than geographic, order (see above, pp. 7f.): the list usually reads Hierapolis, Eukarpeia, Lysias, Augustopolis, Brouzos, Otrous, Lykaones, and Stektorion (1.347, 2-411, etc.).</p>
               <p>3. For the <hi rend="bold">inscription honoring Alexander</hi> see Ramsay, <hi rend="italic"> CBP</hi> , 702, no. 638 (= <hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> IV.692). For the reading <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00554.gif"/> (Ramsay, <hi rend="italic"> JHS</hi> 8 [1887] 478; <hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> IV.692,) rather than <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00555.gif"/> (Legrand and Chamonard, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 17 [1893] 277; Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 702) see Leschhorn, <hi rend="italic">Gründer</hi> , 221-22. The confusion over the two proposed readings allows no definitive resolution. It is not clear whether <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Legrand and Chamonard incorrectly cited Ramsay's <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> text, and Ramsay then compounded the error by citing Legrand and Chamonard in <hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 702, or whether <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> in <hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> Ramsay was suggesting an improved reading over his earlier edition in the <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> article! In any event, <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00556.gif"/> and <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00557.gif"/> have the same meaning in the Roman period. See L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 102 (1978) 438; M. Christol and T. Drew-Bear, <hi rend="italic">JS</hi> (1991) 213 n. 63. Legrand and Chamonard (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> [1893] 278) suggested the stone may have been brought from Brouzos (Kara Sandikli).</p>
               <p>The tradition of claiming <hi rend="bold">Alexander the Great as the founder of a particular city</hi> , especially under the Empire, was widespread in the Middle East. For examples from Asia Minor see Appendix II. In Roman Syria a coin of the Severan period from Gerasa has the legend A<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> E<hi rend="Symbol">X</hi> (AN<hi rend="Symbol">D</hi> PO<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> ) MAK(E<hi rend="Symbol">LW</hi> N) KTI(<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> TH<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> ) <hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> EPA<hi rend="Symbol">SW</hi> N (H. Seyrig, <hi rend="italic">Syria</hi> 42 [1965] 25-28), and a coin of Capitolias with a portrait of Commodus bears, on the reverse, the legend KA<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> I(T<hi rend="Symbol">WL</hi> E<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N) A<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> E<hi rend="Symbol">X</hi> (AN<hi rend="Symbol">D</hi> PO<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> ) MAKE(<hi rend="Symbol">DW</hi> N) <hi rend="Symbol">G</hi> ENAP(XH<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> ) (Seyrig, <hi rend="italic">Syria</hi> 36 [1959] 66f., 76, no. 9); see further Leschhorn, <hi rend="italic">Gründer</hi> , 218-21. For an example of "Alexandrolatry" under the Severi in Europe see THESSALONIKE, note 7. With regard to the Çorhisar inscription C. P. Jones has noted in a private communication that the accusative case and the lack of the dedicator's name suggest that this was one of a series of statue bases of major city founders and benefactors (cf., for example, PERGAMON and ARSINOE Ephesos). Thus it is probable that the Alexander on the inscription was the Macedonian king; see, for example, Tscherikower (34-35; see also F. Pfister, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> . 13 [1964] 65; Leschhorn, <hi rend="italic"> Gründer</hi> , 22-22). What settlement was claiming Alexander as its founder is, as I have mentioned, not known. Ramsay believed it was Otrous. On the other hand, Drew-Bear has argued (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 115 [1991] 374-75 n. 56) that the inscription <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> was brought from the site of EUKARPEIA, <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> referred to</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_318" n="318"/>
               <p>Eukarpeia, and <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> commemorated the Macedonian king as the founder of that town.</p>
               <p>Another, less likely, possibility is that the person honored was a prominent citizen who claimed descent from the original Macedonian settlers. This was not unusual. The use of "Makedon" as a name, surname, or ethnic was common, especially in Asia Minor of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ; see Appendix III. Ramsay (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 702-3, followed by E Cartington, <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> 27 [1977] 125) as well as Legrand and Chamonard (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> [1893] 278) have suggested he was a local citizen. If "Alexander the Macedonian" lived at the beginning of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ., he might be identical with "Alexander the Asiarch," whose name appears on coins of Otrous from c. 200 to 215 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> .; see, for example, <hi rend="italic">Inv. Wadd</hi> . 6368, 6371; <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> (von A) 3905, 3906, 8430, 8431; <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 344-45, nos. 6, 12-14; see also M. Rossner, <hi rend="italic">Studii Clasice</hi> 16 (1974) 113.

               <p>Peltai was an "inhabited city" at the time of the <hi rend="italic"> anabasis</hi> of Cyrus the Younger (Xen. <hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 1.2.10).

Ramsay suggested (685-86) that since the figure on the OTROUS coin holds no weapon in his raised right hand, this represents a peaceful emigration to Otrous. On the other hand, on the Stektorion coinage the figure has a helmet, holds a weapon with his right hand, and protects himself with a shield. According to Ramsay, this represents expulsion from overseas of the people who settled at Stektorion.

               <p>The evidence for Synnada being a Hellenistic colony is not very clear. In a confused entry Stephanos (s.v. "Synnada") attributes its foundation to Akamas son of Theseus, who supposedly migrated to Phrygia after the Trojan War and founded the city, using "Macedonians from Greece" to populate it. Clearly Stephanos has conflated a tradition about an earlier migration with one about a later Macedonian colonization.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Like the inhabitants of other Phrygian cities, in the first to the third century,<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> the Synnadans claimed descent from Greece.

               </p>
               <p>Antigonos' general Dokimos was in command of Synnada and surrendered it to Lysimachos in 302 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> At the time there was a major royal treasure at Synnada (Diod. 20.107.3-4; Paus. 1.8.1). If a colony had been established there by Antigonos or Dokimos, then it would rank as one of the oldest in Asia Minor.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> By the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Synnada was regularly passing decrees.

Kienast, <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> . 26 (1977) 250-52, identified BA AP with King Ariarathes V of Cappadocia; Mørkholm, <hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 24 (1979) 52-54, modified Kienast's chronology and claimed the king was Ariarathes IV because he must have given assistance to Eumenes in the latter's battle with the Gauls; Kleiner, <hi rend="italic">ECC</hi> , 81, and <hi rend="italic">ANA MN</hi> (1980)47, doubted "that any King Ar ... is involved with these pieces," but could offer no other solution; however, he did speculate that AP might stand for either a mint official or a city ethnic. Le Rider has recently suggested that the letters BA should be read as a monogram, <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00567.gif"/>, and that the letters <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00568.gif"/> AP (as well as <hi rend="Symbol">Q</hi> , which he also reads) are "trois monétaires" (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 114 [1990] 691-701). Furthermore he suggested these cistophori should be attributed to BLAUNDOS. In fact this series is part of a small group of cistophori others of which have the monogram <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00569.gif"/>, <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00570.gif"/>, and <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00571.gif"/>. They are remarkable because the three obverse dies used to produce them are also found with reverses from other mints, two Sardian and one Pergamene (Kleiner-Noe, <hi rend="italic">ECC</hi> , 26, ser. 11b [Pergamon], and 79-81, ser. 5-8 [Sardis-Synnada]). Kleiner-Noe believed that the coins were produced at a central mint—Pergamon—in the period 160-150 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , and the monograms denoted the city in whose name the coins were issued. Noe assigned all the coins to SARDIS, while Kleiner attributed coins with <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00572.gif"/> to Sardis</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_325" n="325"/>
               <p>and those with <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00573.gif"/> and <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00574.gif"/> to Synnada (<hi rend="italic">ECC</hi> , 79-81). Mørkholm, on the other hand, speculated that the first coins were struck at Pergamon for Synnada and that later a temporary mint was established at Synnada itself; he dated this to 168-166 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when the Gauls were threatening the region (<hi rend="italic">ANS MN</hi> 24 [1979] 50-53). Le Rider preferred a date after the defeat of the Gauls in 166 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> and, on the basis of a study of the monograms, suggested reassigning not just the BA coins to Blaundos but also the coins with the monogram <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00575.gif"/> to DIONYSOPOLIS. In addition, cistophori with the monogram <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00576.gif"/> he thought might be assigned to either Synnada, LYSIAS, or NYSA (<hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 114 [1990] 689-701). Of these three possibilities, Le Rider dismissed Nysa as the least likely, because it is removed geographically from Dionysopolis and Blaundos: a somewhat circular argument. But is there a delta to the left in the monogram, or is it a lambda? If it is a lambda, the coins may possibly be assigned to Lysias.</p>

               <head rend="Heading-Heading3">Themisonion</head>
               <p>It is likely that Themisonion was a Hellenistic foundation. Nevertheless we cannot definitely identify the founder. We know of at least three persons named Themison in the Hellenistic period: a nauarch of Antigonos Monophthalmos (Diod. 19.62.7, 20.50.4; see Billows, <hi rend="italic">Antigonos</hi> , 436), a friend and official of Antiochos II (Ath. 7.289f, 10.438d), and a friend of Antiochos III (Polyb. 5.79.12 and 82.11). Furthermore it is not possible to say whether the colony was named by the king to honor a royal favorite or whether it was founded by one of the Themisons as an independent agent.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The only extant coins date from the early third century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> While the location of Themisonion is not definitely known, most suggestions would place it southeast of Denizli in the Acipayamovasi, possibly at Karahüyük.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>

                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 175. If the town was named by the king for his minister, this may have happened when Themison was proclaimed Herakles (Ath. 7.289f-290a) and Antiochos received the name "Theos" from the Milesians (App., <hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> .</p>

               <p>65). Berve (<hi rend="italic">Die Tyrannis bei den Griechen</hi> [Munich, 1976] 1:426) believed Antiochos II's minister, acting as an independent dynast, founded the city. Jones (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 49) also pointed to its founding by a dynast but was reluctant to indicate which Themison it was. Tarn was likewise doubtful the Themison in question was the favorite of Antiochos II (<hi rend="italic">GBI</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 11 n. 6). Pausanias (10.32.4-5) mentions the flight of the inhabitants of Themisonion to a cave thirty stades away to avoid marauding Gauls (see Ramsay, <hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 264). We do not know, however, whether he refers to the Gallic invasion of 278 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> or the later raids of the 230s <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> , when the Gauls were allied with Antiochos Hierax.</p>

               <p>3. For the general <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of Themisonion in southwestern Phrygia see Ptol. 5.2.17; Hierokles 666.3; Pausanias (10.32.4) says it was "above Laodikeia." The <hi rend="italic">Tab. Peut</hi> . (IX.1) places it on the road to Perge; see further, Ramsay, <hi rend="italic"> CBP</hi> , 253 and n. 3; Ruge, 1640; Mersich, op. cit. and map at end. The placing of Themisonion at Karahüyük has been suggested by Ramsay (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 252-53, following Waddington) and is based on the following: Livy indicates (38.14.1-2) that Manlius, in his march from the Maeander valley toward Pamphylia, came to the <hi rend="italic">Casum amnem</hi> (other MSS read <hi rend="italic">Cahum, Chaum, Causamenem</hi> ) three days after he had left Tabai. From the river, Manlius took a day to reach Eriza, then another to get to a fort called "Thabusion" that overlooked the Indos River and was near Kibyra. Now there are extant coins of Themisonion with a river god and the legend KAZANH<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> on the reverse (e.g., <hi rend="italic">BMC Phrygia</hi> , 418, no. 4; <hi rend="italic">Inv. Wadd</hi> . 6564-65; <hi rend="italic"> SNG</hi> [Cop] <hi rend="italic">Phrygia</hi> 750). Ramsay suggested that the <hi rend="italic"> Casum amnem</hi> and the Kazanes were one and the same and that they are in fact the Karahüyük Çay, the river that flows past the modern Karahüyük (accepted with reservations by Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 1157). Robert (<hi rend="italic">VAM</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 112 n. 4 and 116 n. 6) would apparently search for Themisonion in the Acipayamovasi (i.e., the plain of Karahüyük) but is sceptical about the choice of Karahüuük.</p>
               <p>An inscription probably from 114 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> found at Karahüyük records an honorific decree voted by the <hi rend="italic">boule</hi> and <hi rend="italic">demos</hi> and mentions, among other things, <hi rend="italic">strategoi</hi> , a gymnasiarch, <hi rend="italic"> grammateus</hi> , and eponymous priest (G.

The preserved section does not indicate the name of the city that passed the decree. Hansen (<hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 199) assumed it was Themisonion; Ramsay (<hi rend="italic">CBP</hi> , 260) thought it "probably" was. Cousin and Diehl thought it might have been Eriza.</p>

               <p>Patara was a port on the Lycian coast (Diod. 20.93.3). According to Strabo (14.3.6), Ptolemy II Philadelphos restored (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00577.gif"/>) Patara and renamed it Arsinoe in Lycia. The city was named for Ptolemy's wife and sister. Strabo does not provide any details about the nature of the restoration. We do not know precisely when the name change took place. Two Zenon papyri, one of c. 259 and the other from 257 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">P. Mich. Zen</hi> . 1 and 10), refer to it as "Patara."<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Therefore we must assume either that at this time the name change had not been effected or, if it had, that the old name still continued in use along with the new. In fact, the extant evidence from abroad suggests that the latter was the case. Two inscriptions from Cyprus, one dated to 224/3 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and the other to 163-145 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , attest the use of the ethnic <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00578.gif"/>.

Bar-Kochva (<hi rend="italic">Seleucid Army</hi> . 216 n. 27) denies they were Hellenistic colonists and, following a suggestion of Launey (<hi rend="italic">Recherches</hi> , 486 n. 4), raises the possibility that the Kardakians were brought to Lycia by the Persians.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi rend="bold">identity of the Kardakians</hi> is not certain. They may have been identical with the Kardouchoi, possible ancestors of the modern Kurds (A. J.</p>

               <p>4. <hi rend="bold">The Ptolemy who sold the land to the Kardakians</hi> was undoubtedly Ptolemy son of Lysimachos, the Ptolemy of Telmessos who had owned land there (Livy 37.56.4-5); see Segre, 198-99.

A Cypriot inscription, dated palaeographically to the late third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , honors a commandant of Charadros in Cilicia, Theodoros son of Demetrios, who was an "Arsinoean from Pamphylia." And an inscription on a funerary urn in Alexandreia from the year eight of an unknown king tells us the vase contained the remains of a native of Arsinoe of Pamphylia.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pamphylia was already under Ptolemaic control in 278 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and—with interruptions—remained under Ptolemaic control until it fell to Antiochos III in 197.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Within this time frame it is most probable that Ptolemy II Philadelphos founded Arsinoe. Arsinoe was located very near a region that was an important source of shipbuilding timber later exploited by Cleopatra VII (Strabo 14.5.3). It is quite likely, therefore, that Philadelphos founded Arsinoe in connection with his naval program.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The precise location has not yet been discovered. Strabo says that after Korakesion (the modern Alanya) there was a polis named Arsinoe (14.5.3): <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00582.gif"/>. It is likely that Arsinoe was a coastal settlement east of Korakesion.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>

               <p>Prior to the discovery of the epigraphic evidence for Arsinoe in Pamphylia it was argued that the Arsinoe near Korakesion in Strabo 14.5.3 was an error and that the text should be emended to either Syedra (Ruge, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Syedra") or Aunesis (Müller, in <hi rend="italic">GGM</hi> , 1: 487-88); contra now, Bean and Mitford, <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> (1962) 196 n. 22; Robert, <hi rend="italic">EEP</hi> , 255 n. 2. It is possible that this Arsinoe or Arsinoe in Cilicia is referred to in <hi rend="italic">P. Mich. Zen</hi> . 10.5 and 13; see ARSINOE Patara.</p>
               <p>2. The situation of Pamphylia in the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> was, as Meyer has remarked, "etwas unklar" (<hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 137). Ptolemy H Philadelphos appointed a Pamphyli[arch] over the region in 278 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">DocAMM</hi> , 53-58; J. and L. Robert <hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1967] 601), and Theocritus (17.88) listed Pamphylia among Philadelphos' possessions. What is not clear is how extensive his rule was or how long it lasted. According to the Adoulis inscription (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 54.14) Ptolemy III</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_336" n="336"/>
               <p>Euergetes I claimed Pamphylia as his conquest. When Philadelphos lost control of Pamphylia is not clear. Presumably this happened during the Second Syrian War, i.e., before 253 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Antiochos II probably then controlled Pamphylia until he lost it to Euergetes I, undoubtedly during the Third Syrian War (246-241 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ). The Ptolemies again lost most of Pamphylia two decades later. H. Seyrig called attention to four series of posthumous Alexanders from Perge, Aspendos, Sillyon, and Phaseils, which are dated by an era (Phaselis and Perge, years 1-33; Aspendos, years 1-31; Sillyon, years 3-11) that, according to Seyrig, probably began in 221 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Then Seyrig suggested that these cities freed themselves shortly after Euergetes' death in 221 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">RN</hi> [1963] 38-51; on the other hand, Boehringer [<hi rend="italic">Zur Chronologie</hi> , 52-62] claimed that we are dealing not with a common "Pamphylian Era" but rather with eras starting at different years for each city, i.e., 219 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> for Perge and Sillyon, 218 for Phaselis, 210 for Aspendos; however, the discovery of an obverse die link between the coinage of Perge and Aspendos disproves Boehringer's suggestion; see Mørkholm, <hi rend="italic">EHC</hi> , 143). Finally, in 218 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Achaios overran most of Pamphylia (Polyb. 5.77.1), and this effectively ended Ptolemaic rule over most of the region. On the shifting pattern of Ptolemaic and Seleucid control over Pamphylia see Huss, <hi rend="italic"> Aussen</hi> ., 190-91; Bagnall, <hi rend="italic">Ptol. Poss</hi> ., 110-14; Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 44-45, 137; and SELEUKEIA in Pamphylia. The two possibilities for the <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> of Arsinoe in Pamphylia are Ptolemy II and III. Of these Philadelphos is the far more likely candidate. He was, of course, married to Arsinoe II and named numerous other colonies for her. Furthermore he was especially active founding colonies on the south coast of Asia Minor.</p>
               <p>3 For <hi rend="bold">Philadelphos' shipbuilding activities in Cyprus</hi> see ARSINOE Marion.</p>
               <p>4. Previously it was suggested that <hi rend="bold">Strabo's account</hi> was confused and that Korakesion itself might have been refounded as an Arsinoe (Jones, <hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 199, followed by Bean and Mitford, <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> 12 [1962] 195-96; see also J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BE</hi> [1965] 421, and <hi rend="italic">Amyzon</hi> , 157 n. 8). In addition, Jones suggested that ARSINOE in Cilicia and Nagidos, which Strabo distinguished (14.5.3), were also identical (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 199). However, the publication in 1989 of an inscription of the later third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> from Arsinoe in Cilicia clearly showed the two cities coexisting (E. Kirsten and I. Opelt, <hi rend="italic">ZPE</hi> 77 [1989] 55-66, esp. 61-62; C. E Jones and G. Habicht, <hi rend="italic">Phoenix</hi> 43 [1989] 317-46, esp. 333-34). This renders less likely the view that Arsinoe in Pamphylia and Korakesion were identical (<hi rend="italic">nota bene</hi> that in i938 L. Robert suggested that Arsinoe in Pamphylia was located a little to the east of Korakesion, <hi rend="italic">EEP</hi> , 255 n. 2). The problem of Hamaxia, which Strabo (14-5.3) says was east and which the <hi rend="italic">Stadiasmus</hi> (208) says was west of Korakesion, remains unresolved; J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">BE</hi> (1965) 42e; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">DocAMM</hi> , 67; G. P.

               <p>Strabo describes Attaleia in Pamphylia as follows: <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00585.gif"/>

               <p>1. Leake (<hi rend="italic">Asia Minor</hi> , 192), Hirschfeld (loc. cit.), Tscherikower (loc. cit.), and Radet (<hi rend="italic">RA</hi> [1890] 218) understood Strabo to mean that Attalos established the new foundation next to Korykos and then surrounded <hi rend="italic">both</hi> towns with a larger wall. Petersen (in <hi rend="italic">Städte Pamphyliens und Pisidiens</hi> , 1:14 and n. 3) rejected Strabo's use of <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00589.gif"/> to describe the relative location of Korykos to Attaleia and suggested that there was no Korykos in Pamphylia; see also Ruge, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.vv. "Korykos 3" and "Attaleia 3," as well as Magie, 1133. The problem is that there were a number of localities called Korykos on the southern Asia Minor coast. There was a Korykos in Lycia (Strabo 14.3.8, 5.7; <hi rend="italic">Stadiasmus</hi> , 227-28 [<hi rend="italic">GGM</hi> , 1: 490]; O. Benndorf, in <hi rend="italic">Festschift Otto Hirschfeld</hi> [Berlin, 1903] 83 n. 2) and a more famous one in Cilicia (Strabo 14.5.5; see also <hi rend="italic"> MAMA</hi> II, pp. 90-93; A. Machatschek, <hi rend="italic">DAWW</hi> 96 [1967] 13); on the confusion between the two see Magie, 1168 and references; also Ormerod, <hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> 12 (1922) 42-44.</p>
               <p>The evidence for a Korykos in Pamphylia is equivocal. Stephanos (s.v. "Attaleia") said Attalos Philadelphos folded Attaleia but mistakenly transferred Attaleia to the <hi rend="italic">Cilician</hi> Korykos. The Suda (s.v. "Korykaios") placed Korykos</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_338" n="338"/>
               <p>in Pamphylia, said it was the site of Attaleia, and added that it was on a promontory. This is embarrassing because while Cilician Korykos—according to Strabo 14.5.5—was built on a promontory, Attaleia in Pamphylia was not. Dionysios Periegetes mentions a Korykos in Pamphylia along with Perge and Phaselis (855; = <hi rend="italic">GGM</hi> , 2:156; cf. Nikephoros <hi rend="italic">Geog. Synop</hi> . 847-77 = <hi rend="italic">GGM</hi> , 2: 465); but, as Ormerod notes, "if Attaleia is intended, it is badly misplaced" (<hi rend="italic">JRS</hi> [1922] 43 n. 1). The only other evidence for a Pamphylian Korykos is Strabo's use of the term <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00590.gif"/> (14.4.1). If he is accurate in his usage, then we must conclude that Attalos simultaneously built two adjacent colonies. This is unlikely. The normal practice in such situations was to establish a foundation at a site adjacent to a native town, not to colonize simultaneously the native town as well. If, however, Strabo used the term mistakenly or rather loosely, then we may follow Petersen's suggestion, deny the existence of a Pamphylian Korykos and posit two separate Pergamene colonies, one in Lycia and one in Pamphylia.</p>
               <p>2. Petersen and von Luschan (<hi rend="italic">Reisen in südwestlichen Kleinasien</hi> , vol. 2, <hi rend="italic">Reisen in Lykien, Milyas und Kibyratis</hi> [Vienna, 1889] 178) suggested that Attalos founded Attaleia when he took part in the expedition of Manlius. But Magie rightly objected (1133) that <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> there is no evidence Manlius entered the Pamphylian plain and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> it is unlikely that Attalos would have named a foundation after himself during the reign of his brother, Eumenes. Hopp (<hi rend="italic">Unter</hi> ., 103-4) prefers the later date, though he allows that Attalos might have discovered the site in 189. For Attalos' march on Selge in 158 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> see Pomp. Trog. <hi rend="italic">Prol. Libri</hi> 34 (ed. Seel [1935], p. 320).</p>
               <p>3. The similarity of cults at Attaleia and Pergamon led Petersen to suggest (in <hi rend="italic">Stüdte Pamphyliens und Pisidiens</hi> , 15, followed by Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> , 178, 453) that some of the colonists came from the latter. On <hi rend="bold">Dionysos</hi> at Attaleia see <hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> III 780.8; at Pergamon he was called Kathegemon (Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>

On the duration and extent of the shifting Ptolemaic control over Pamphylia see ARSINOE in Pamphylia and references cited there. C. C. Edgar's suggestion (commentary to <hi rend="italic">P. Mich.

However, the attribution is very uncertain.

According to Theocritus (17.88) Pamphylia was a possession of Ptolemy II Philadelphos; according to the Adoulis inscription (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 54.14) Ptolemy III Euergetes I conquered it. Philadelphos probably lost Pamphylia during the Second Syrian War</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_341" n="341"/>
               <p>(260-253 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), and Euergetes I probably regained it during the Third Syrian War (246-241 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ). What is not clear is how much territory in Pamphylia Philadelphos controlled, what he lost, and what territories Euergetes I actually controlled. Nevertheless <hi rend="bold"> it is likely that Antiochos I founded Seleukeia</hi> and named it for his father (see Tscherikower [175] and Meyer [<hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 44], who speculates that Antiochos founded it to counter the Ptolemaic Aspendos). A founding date for Seleukeia after the Third Syrian War is unlikely. The chaos and civil wars brought on by Hierax and Achaios reduced Seleucid control in western and central Asia Minor and brought to an end the great age of settlement foundings. In Pamphylia, Achaios seized control from Ptolemy IV Philopator in 218 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Polyb. 5.77.1). When Antiochos III came into possession of the area is not dear. Schmitt suggests he wrested Achaios' Pamphylian territory in the period 216-213 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Antiochos</hi> , 279); Seyrig assumes he took it over after the final defeat of Achaios in 213 (<hi rend="italic">RN</hi> [1963] 41). In any event, both Livy (33.19.11, 20.4-5) and Hieronymus (<hi rend="italic">In Dan</hi> . 11.15-16 = <hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 260 F46) mention Antiochos' conquests in 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> along the Lycian and Cilician coast but omit any reference to Pamphylia; see above, p. 335 and note 2; Huss, <hi rend="italic">Aussen</hi> ., 190-91; Schmitt, <hi rend="italic">Antiochos</hi> , 182f., 279; Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 44-45, 137; and ARSINOE in Pamphylia.

Was this dedication put up by a Hellenistic colonist? I think not. It is unlikely that an Antigonid or Seleucid colonist of the late fourth/early third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> would have set up a bilingual inscription. There were, of course, Greeks in the East who were bilingual. For example, Diodorus (17.110.4-5) mentions the case of a colony of Boeotians living east of the Tigris River in Sittakene. They had been brought (exiled? cf. Hdt. 6.119 and above, p. 16) to their dwelling place by Xerxes. A century and a half later they spoke</p>

                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 175) is less likely: most Seleucid kings named colonies</p>

               <p>for themselves, their parents, or their wives (cf. App. <hi rend="italic"> Syr</hi> . 57: Seleukos I named cities for his father, mother, himself, and his wives). It is unlikely that Antiochos I would have named a city for his grandmother, niece (and daughter-in-law), or granddaughter. Magie tentatively suggested Antiochos II or III (456) but then acknowledged that because "there is no mention of the place before Artemidorus, there is no means of determining when or by whom it was founded" (1313).

Calder first suggested it referred to the charred and blackened hills near the town (<hi rend="italic">Studies Ramsay</hi> , 68); later he changed his mind and hypothesized that it "originated as the Greek disguise of an old local name displaced by 'Laodicea'" (<hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> I, p. xv). J.A. Cramer thought it referred to the "volcanic nature of the district" (<hi rend="italic">A Geographical and Historical Description of Asia Minor</hi> [Oxford, 1832] 2: 33), but Hamilton claimed there is no "volcanic or igneous rock" in the area (<hi rend="italic">Researches</hi> , 2: 194). Schmitz (Smith, <hi rend="italic">Dict. Geog</hi> . s.v. "Laodiceia Combusta") followed Hamilton's assertion and suggested the town was at some time destroyed by fire and given the epithet when it was rebuilt! Kiepert (<hi rend="italic">FOA</hi> VIII, p. 14a) thought the name was derived from smelting furnaces supposed to have been located at the town (followed by Ruge, op. cit.; von Aulock <hi rend="italic">MSLyk</hi> ., 45).</p>

               <p>2. The Seleucid hold on Pisidia was weak and of relatively short duration. As a result of his victory over Lysimachos at Korupedion in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Seleukos I came into possession of this region. It is, however, unlikely that he founded any colonies in Pisidia in the short time between the battle and his own death some months later. Whatever Seleucid colonizing activity there was in the area was probably undertaken by Antiochos I or II. After the death of the latter, the rebellious activities of Antiochos Hierax and, later, Achaios weakened the already feeble Seleucid hold on Asia Minor west of the Tauros Mountains. Achaios was active plundering in Pisidia (Polyb. 5.57.7) and in 218 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> captured the region of Milyas (Polyb. 5.72.3f., 77.1; on Milyas see A. S. Hall, <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> 36 [1986] 137-57; and APOLLONIA in Phrygia). It is doubtful that Antiochos III, despite some military activity there in 193 (Livy 35.13.5, 15.7; App. <hi rend="italic">Syr</hi> . 9) was able to reassert Seleucid control (see Schmitt, <hi rend="italic">Antiochos</hi> , 279).</p>
               <p>Both Tscherikower (175) and Meyer (<hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 129) suggest Antiochos I as the <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> . Considering his activity establishing colonies elsewhere in Asia Minor and the fact that he named Apameia in Phrygia for his mother, it is possible that he founded Seleukeia in Pisidia and named it for his father.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi rend="bold">identification of the site called Selef with Seleukeia</hi> was made by Hirschfeld, op. cit. He recoguized the ancient name in the modern toponym. He also noted that the village of Agras (the modern Atabey), approximately 4 km north of Selef, was the ancient Agrai, which is often combined with Seleukeia in the Byzantine lists (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Not.

Having heard that he was around the Gulf of Issos with many kings and satraps, I collected many goats, bound torches on their horns, and led them out into the night. When they (i.e., the Persians) saw us, they turned to flee, thinking our army was large. And so I victoriously put them to flight.

               <p>An inscription, now in the museum of Mersin, provides important information about Arsinoe and about the process of founding a colony. The inscription records a letter from Thraseas the <hi rend="italic"> strategos</hi> of Cilicia to Arsinoe and a decree of Nagidos regarding its relations with Arsinoe.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The founder of Arsinoe was Aetos, son of Apollonios, the <hi rend="italic">strategos</hi> of Cilicia. Arsinoe was founded between 279 and 260-253 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and named for Arsinoe II. It was founded as a polls at a strategic place on land taken from the nearby Nagidos.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Aetos, we are told, expelled the barbarians who were encroaching on the land and then brought in settlers and distributed land to them. A generation later Aetos' son Thraseas became <hi rend="italic">strategos</hi> of Cilicia for Ptolemy III Euergetes I and was himself eager to make the city more splendid. At his request, the city of Nagidos agreed to give public land to settlers at Arsinoe who would then be <hi rend="italic">apoikoi</hi> of Nagidos. The Arsinoeans were to have their own laws, conduct their own affairs, and have <hi rend="italic">isopoliteia</hi> with Nagidos. They had <hi rend="italic"> archontes</hi> (though, apparently, not a full complement of magistrates) and a <hi rend="italic">tamias</hi> , sent tribute (<hi rend="italic">phoros</hi> ) to the king, and sent envoys to negotiate with Nagidos. They worshipped the Brother and Sister Gods, Ptolemy II Philadelphos and Arsinoe II, and had a cult of Arsinoe as eponymous goddess. The town name survived the return of the region to Seleucid rule in 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>

               <p>Strabo records (14.5.3) an Arsinoe on the Cilician coast between Anemourion, Nagidos, and Kelenderis (Gilindere) and adds that it had a landing place. A similar location, between Anemourion and Kelenderis, is also given by Ptolemy (5.7.3), the <hi rend="italic">Tabula Peutingeriana</hi> (VIII.2), and the Ravenna Geographer</p>

Strabo twice (12.1.4 and 2.7) records a Castabala that had a cult of Artemis Perasia; however, he locates this Castabala in Cappadocia. It is not possible to conclude whether Strabo has erred or whether there were in fact two Castabalas, one in Cappadocia and one in Cilicia (as Pliny indicates, <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.93 and 6.8).

               <p>1. There are three candidates for <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> of Philadelpheia: Ptolemy II Philadelphos, Attalos II Philadelphos, and Antiochos IV of Commagene. Meyer (<hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 43) believed the Egyptian king established it. Tscherikower objected (39-40) that the probable location of it is too far inland to have been Ptolemaic (see also L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">REA</hi> [1934] 522). However, the recent discovery of what was apparently a Ptolemaic garrison at Meydancikkale, 8 km southeast of Gülnar in ancient Rough Cilicia may be noted (Davesne and Le Rider, <hi rend="italic"> Meydancikkale</hi> ). A dedication to Hermes and Herakles on behalf of Ptolemy III, Berenike II, and their children and the evidence of the extraordinary coin hoard found at the site (<hi rend="italic">Meydancikkale</hi> , 343-48 and passim) allow us to date the garrison to c. 245-235 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Precisely when it was founded we do not know. Nevertheless the presence of a garrison on the northern frontier of Ptolemaic Rough Cilicia raises the possibility that Philadelpheia, despite its probable location in the interior of Cilicia, was likewise a Ptolemaic foundation.</p>
               <p>Tscherikower also dismissed the possibility that k was a foundation of Attalos II on the grounds that the Attalids never controlled Cilicia. He and Robert both followed Ramsay's suggestion (<hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 372-73 and <hi rend="italic">RN</hi> [1894] 169-71) that in the early first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> Antiochos IV of Commagene founded it and named it after his wife, Iotape Philadelphos (see also Jones, <hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>

               <p>Philadelpheia were distinct places (Hill, <hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1899] 184 n. 12). Philadelpheia is named after Germanicopolis and Eirenopolis by Hierokles (710.4), before Eirenopolis in <hi rend="italic">Not. Ep</hi> . 3.517, and before Adras(s)os, ... Eirenopolis, and Germanicopolis in <hi rend="italic"> Not. Ep</hi> . 7.527, 10.748, 13.509 (though <hi rend="italic">nota bene</hi> that cities in the <hi rend="italic">Not. Ep</hi> . are listed in hierarchic rather than geographic order). On the city name in the Byzantine lists see Ruge, op. cit.</p>
               <p>3. The precise <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of Philadelpheia is not yet known (see Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 1408-9). However, there are two general indications. <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Some of the coins bear the legend <hi rend="Symbol">F</hi> I<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> A<hi rend="Symbol">D</hi> E<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> E<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N TH<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> KIHTI<hi rend="Symbol">D</hi> O<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> . It is difficult to give a precise delimitation of the region of K(i)etis: at one point (5.7.3) Ptolemy indicates it included the coastal cities of Rough Cilicia from Anemourion to the mouth of the Kalykadnos; at another (5.7.6) he includes Olbasa (= Olba), which was in the interior. Ramsay was undoubtedly correct when he suggested that K(i)etis was the region of Rough Cilicia on either side of the Kalykadnos from its mouth to its source (<hi rend="italic">HGAM</hi> , 363-65; also Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 1364-65; Hild and Hellenkemper, <hi rend="italic">TIB</hi> V.1: 301). <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> Hierokles (710.4) places Philadelpheia after Eirenopolis (the modern Irnebol) and Germanicopolis (Ermenek), and George of Cyprus (849) locates it before Adrassos (Barabolu). Bean and Mitford point to Imsi Ören, a place 10 km east of Ermenek. Eight inscriptions have thus far been found at the site, but no coins as yet. Nevertheless, Bean and Mitford suggest Philadelpheia may have been located here (216-17 and maps B and C at end).</p>

               <p>Seleukeia on the Kalykadnos (the modern Göksu) River was founded, according to Ammianus (14.8.2) and Stephanos (s.v. "Seleukeia"), by Seleukos I Nikator. The founding would have been after c. 295 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.,</hi> when Seleukos came into possession of Cilicia. The site, which had been occupied before the Hellenistic period, was populated with the inhabitants of a number of neighboring towns. The king also contributed the roof to the important temple of Zeus at Olba, which was twenty kilometers north of Seleukeia.<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> In the early second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> a prominent citizen of Seleukeia, Eudemos, was honored by Argos, Rhodes, the <hi rend="italic">koinon</hi> of the Boeotians, Byzantion, Kalchedon, and Kyzikos.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> In the inscription Eudemos is always referred to simply as a "Seleukeian."

On the other hand, Ptolemy (5.7.5) refers to it as Seleukeia Tracheia, and Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.93) calls it Tracheotis. There was also a royal mint at Seleukeia. The earliest coins that have been assigned to this mint are tetradrachms of Seleukos III and Antiochos III, and the latest are those of Seleukos IV.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Seleukeia was located at the site of the modern Silifke.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>

               <p>1. According to Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.93) Seleukeia was founded when the coastal city of Hermia (= Stephanos' Hyria) was moved to the new, inland site. According to Strabo (14.5.4, followed by Stephanos s.v. "Holmoi") the new city was formed when the inhabitants of Holmoi migrated there. Finally, Stephanos says (s.v. "Seleukeia" and "Hyria") that Seleukeia was previously called Olbia and Hyria. All this suggests, as Tscherikower (39) has theorized, that the new foundation resulted from a synoecism. For archaeological evidence of previous Hellenistic habitation at the site of Seleukeia see E. Gjerstad, <hi rend="italic">RA</hi> (1934) 157.</p>
               <p>Evidence for early Seleucid colonizing activity in Cilicia can be seen at Seleukeia on the Kalykadnos, ANTIOCH on the Kydnos, and, probably, at ANTIOCH on the Pyramos. Is it possible that, in a manner similar to what he did in the region of Seleukis in northern Syria, Nikator was trying to anchor the Seleucid presence in Cilicia with these (and other) colonies?</p>

Referring to Strabo 12.2.6, Magie suggested (<hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 1352) that the town may have been one of the <hi rend="italic">phrouria</hi> that guarded the river crossing. But Strabo there specifies the two <hi rend="italic">phrouria</hi> as Azamora and Dastarkon. The Cappadocian king's name appears as Ariamnaios/Ariamnes in the literary sources (Diod. 31.19.2; Justin 27.3) and Ariaramnes on coinage (e.g., <hi rend="italic">SNG</hi> [von A] 6257).</p>

               <p>Ariaratheia, according to Stephanos (s.v.), was founded by Ariarathes, the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00675.gif"/> of Antiochos. The term <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00676.gif"/> refers to a relationship by marriage.</p>

               <p>1. For Ariarathes IV as the probable <hi rend="bold">founder</hi> see, for example, Hirschfeld, op. cit.; Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen</hi> , 121; Robert, <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 2 (1946) 84 n. 7. On <hi rend="bold">the term</hi>

A further indication of Ariarathes IV's active involvement in the larger Hellenistic world and of his imitation of its fashions is the probability that the first Cappadocian silver coinage was struck at the royal Seleucid mint in Soloi during the reign of his ally and brother-in-law, Antiochos IV Epiphanes (Mørkholm, <hi rend="italic">NC</hi> [1969] 24-25; contra, B. Simonetta, <hi rend="italic">QT</hi> [1973] 37-42). Tscherikower (43) hesitated between Ariarathes IV and the great philhellene Ariarathes V (on whom see Eusebeia near Argaios) but opted for the latter on the analogy with EUSEBEIA near Argaios and the Tauros, both of which he probably founded. Jones (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 174, 430) suggested the founder was Ariarathes III, who was married to the daughter of the Seleucid Antiochos II. Jones notes that the Stephanos passage allows us to identify the founder as either Ariarathes III or IV (both of whom were sons-in-law of an Antiochos) but opts for the former because "the founder of the dynasty is more likely" (430). H. Groethe (<hi rend="italic">Meine Vorderasienexpedition 1906 und 1907</hi> [1912] 2: 28) preferred Ariarathes I. This is not likely. In general see L. Robert, <hi rend="italic"> Hellnica</hi> 2:84 and n. 7.</p>

               <p>According to Strabo (12.2.7) Mazaka was renamed "Eusebeia near Argaios" (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00680.gif"/>). He does not say, however, who was the founder. Probably it was the Cappadocian king Ariarathes V Eusebes Philopator (163-130 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ), who was a well-known philhellene.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Of course in refounding Mazaka as a Eusebeia Ariarathes would have been imitating other Hellenistic kings. The new name was in use until 12-9 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , when Archelaos renamed the city Caesarea.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eusebeia was the capital of the Cappadocian kingdom and the residence of a royal official, <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00681.gif"/> who was probably the governor.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> According to Strabo the city used "the laws of Charondas" and chose a "Nomodos" to interpret the law. In Strabo's time the city was unwalled.</p>
               <p>Tigranes depopulated the city in order to settle Tigranokerta (Strabo 12.2.9). After his defeat in 69 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> at the hands of Lucullus the inhabitants were allowed to return home. Subsequently Pompey rebuilt the city (App. <hi rend="italic"> Mith</hi> . 115).<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eusebeia Caesarea was located north of Mount Argaios (Erciyes Dag) on the great "Common Road" that connected the Aegean coast of Asia Minor with Mesopotamia (Strabo 14.2.29). It was at the site of the modern Kayseri.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>

               <p>1. On the probability that Ariarathes V (rather than Ariarathes IV, Ari-arathes IX, Ariobarzanes III, Ariarathes X—all surnamed Eusebes) founded Eusebeia see Niese, <hi rend="italic">GMS</hi> , 3:249 n. 6; Ruge, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v. "Tyana," 1637; Teja, 1105. Diodorus (31.19.7-8) comments on the fact that Ariarathes V received a "Greek education," was devoted to philosophy; and made Cappadocia a cultural center. Diogenes Laertins (4.65) tells us that he carried on a correspondence with the philosopher Carnearies. Ariarathes V received Athenian citizenship and joined his brother-in-law, Attalos II, in erecting a statue of Carneades in Athens (<hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 666). With his wife he also made a gift to the Dionysiac Artists at Athens ( <hi rend="italic"> OGIS</hi> 353).</p>
               <p>2. The <hi rend="bold">name "Eusebeia"</hi> —rather than the ethnic, as is more commonly the case—is found on coins dating from the reign of Archelaos.

               <p>twenty-fifth year of Archaelos (i.e., until 13/2 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ).

               <p>Stephen Mitchell has suggested that the appearance of a Thracian name at Pessinus in northern Galatia "may... be a remnant of a Hellenistic settlement although ... there is no other evidence to support this explanation." As Mitchell notes, we would need further evidence before positing the existence of a Hellenistic colony at Pessinus.</p>

               <p>According to Strabo (12.3.10), Amastris, the wife of Dionysios of Heraldeia (and later, the wife of Lysimachos), founded, by synoecism, a city bearing her name. The new foundation combined four settlements: Sesamos, Kytoros, Kromna, and Tieion. She did this shortly after 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Tieion soon (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00690.gif"/>) withdrew from the union. This may have happened as a result of the murder of Amastris by her sons (c. 284 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> ). Sesamos served as the acropolis of the new city.</p>
               <p>After Amastris' death Lysimachos took control of the city and ultimately gave it to his wife, Arsinoe. After the battle of Korupedion, Eumenes who was in charge (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00691.gif"/>) of Amastris surrendered the city to the Pon-tic Ariobarzanes.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> During the Mithridatic War Nikomedes plundered the territory of Amastris. Later, in 70 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , Lucullus captured the town (App. <hi rend="italic">Mith</hi> . 82).</p>

               </p>
               <p>The four communities that originally constituted the new city of Amastris were spread out over seventy-five kilometers of the Black Sea coastline. Being the acropolis, Sesamos came to be known as Amastris. The name survives in the modern Amasra.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>

Ptolemy records the existence of a polls in the Tauric Chersonese named Eupatoria (cf. Atom. Marc. 22.8.36). If Ptolemy is correct, then the polls Eupatoria is to be distinguished from the fortress Eupatorion.</p>
               <p>

               <p>It is necessary to distinguish the ancient Eupatorion from the modern Ukranian city of Eupatoriia on the west coast of the Crimean peninsula, sixty-four kilometers northwest of Simferopol. This modern city stands on the site of the archaic Greek colony of Kerkinitos. The site became the Turkish fortress of Gezlev.

               <p>Stephanos describes Kressa (s.v.) as a polis in Paphlagonia that Ziaëlas the son of Nikomedes captured. Droysen suggested that Kressa was identical with Krateia (the later Flaviopolis) in Paphlagonia. Following upon this, Jones cited the mention of the Thracian names Seuthes and Ziailis in an inscription from Krateia (<hi rend="italic">CIG</hi> 3808) as evidence that Kressa had been a Bithynian colony. However, the identification of Krateia with Kressa is highly doubtful.

               <p>1. Strabo does not mention Laodikeia; he does, however, refer both to Kizari, a fortress on the shores of Lake Stephane that he describes as deserted, and to a nearby ruined palace (12.3.38). It is quite likely that Kizari is to be identified with a ruined fortress located on a limestone bluff that rises behind Lâdik. Furthermore, it is possible that Laodikeia was a Hellenistic refounding that consisted of both the fortress and the palace. The destruction of the town may have occurred during the Third Mithridatic War; this might explain Strabo's use of the old, rather than the Hellenistic, name. Interestingly, it is the Hellenistic name that ultimately survived. See further, Anderson, op. cit.; Olshausen and Biller, op. cit.</p>

               <p>3. Arrian (who lived in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ) claimed that <hi rend="bold">Pharnakeia was earlier called Kerasous</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Peripl Pont. Eux</hi> . 24 [= <hi rend="italic"> GGM</hi> , 1: 391]). It is interesting to note that around this same time (i.e., second century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ) coins of Kerasous (the modern Giresun) first seem to have appeared (e.g., Head, <hi rend="italic">HN</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> 497; <hi rend="italic"> SNG</hi> [von A] 122, 6771). Arrian also claimed Kerasous was a colony of Sinope. In making this claim Arrian apparently confused Kerasous (Giresun) with another Kerasous farther east on the Black Sea coast, near Vakfikebir. This is the Kerasous that Xenophon visited and identified as a colony of Sinope (<hi rend="italic">Anab</hi> . 5.3.2; Bayer and Winfield, <hi rend="italic">Byzantine Monuments</hi> , 152; for the distinction of Pharnakeia from Kerasous see also Strabo 12.3.17; Pliny [<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 6.11] and Ptolemy [5.6.5] also distinguished the two towns but unfortunately confused their locations). Wilson suggested (op. cit., 248) that the Pharnakeians assumed the name of Kerasous in order "to identify themselves with the earlier colony." In this connection Wilson noted that the population of Pharnakeia included settlers from Kotyora, which was itselfa colony of Sinope. On the other hand, it may simply be, as Wilson also noted, that Kerasous was in fact an earlier name of Pharnakeia (see the statement in Arrian cited above).</p>

               <p>Wehrli (<hi rend="italic">Antig</hi> ., 83) and Billows (<hi rend="italic">Antigonos</hi> , 297) connect Antigoneia with the Daskyleion that had been a satrapal residence, i.e., with Hisartepe.

               <p>Corsten (59-61; see also Magie, <hi rend="italic">RRAM</hi> , 971, and Tscherikower, 49), has suggested that Antigoneia near Daskyleion might have been identical with NIKAIA. Both Strabo (12.4.7) and Stephanos (s.v. "Nikaia") indicate that Nikaia was previously founded as an Antigoneia. Strabo adds that it was colonized by Antigonos Monophthalmos. Neither, however, connect this city with Antigoneia near Daskyleion. Furthermore Nikaia could hardly be described as near (<figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00696.gif"/>) Daskyleion. (See also the early suggestion of Hasluck, <hi rend="italic">Cyzicus</hi> , 58, that Daskyleion was at the site of the modern Bursa [= Prousa]—thus the appropriateness of describing Nikaia as "near" Daskyleion.

               <p>Stephanos distinguishes Antigoneia near Daskyleion from ANTIGONEIA "a phrourion of the Kyzikene, fifty stades from the Western Sea." A decree of Eretria honors three Antigoneians who were friends of Demetrios Poliorketes (<hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 348). Unfortunately there is no indication which Antigoneia this was. Diodorus (20.111.3) says that in 302 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Demetrios campaigned in the Hellespont and recovered a number of cities, among them Lampsakos and Parion. Thus if Antigonos did found Antigoneia near Daskyleion, it is possible that the persons honored in the Eretrian decree came from this city. See further ALEXANDREIA Troas.</p>

Polybius adds that (15.22.1) Prousias was a <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00699.gif"/> of Philip V; he does not, however, specify the relationship. In fact we do not know the name or the origin of Prousias I's wife. On the other hand, Stephanos (s.vv. "Apameia" and "Myrleia") attributes the founding to Prousias' grandson, Nikomedes II Epiphanes. Stephanos adds that Nikomedes named it for his mother, Apama.

               <p>2. For <hi rend="bold">Apollonia as a colony of Miletos</hi> see. <hi rend="italic">I Milet</hi> 155. J. Seibert's rejection (<hi rend="italic">Metropolis und Apoikie</hi> [Würzburg, 1963] 197-200) of the historicity of the account in. <hi rend="italic">I Milet</hi> 155 was correctly challenged by L. Robert (<hi rend="italic">Opera Minors</hi> , 4: 292-94; see earlier E Bilabel, <hi rend="italic"> Die ionische Kolonisation</hi> , Philolog. Suppl. XIV [Leipzig, 1921] 45-46, who also accepted the evidence of <hi rend="italic">I. Milet</hi> 155). N. Ehrhardt (<hi rend="italic">Milet und seine Kolonien</hi> [Frankfurt, 1983] 44-46) considered the Milesian decree "suspect" and suggested that Apollonia might have been a "secondary" foundation of Kyzikos (the latter was a colony of Miletos). Jones (<hi rend="italic">CERP</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 36-37 and n. 15) suggested Apollonia was an old Milesian colony that was renamed by the Attalids. See also A. Abmeier, <hi rend="italic">Asia Minor Studien</hi> 1 (1990) 11, who suggested Apollonia was founded between 183 and c. 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> on the site of an earlier settlement and was named for Apollonis. Note, however, L. Robert's objection that <hi rend="bold">the toponym Apollonia</hi> was normally given in honor of Apollo, the patron god of colonization, and not for Attalos II's mother (<hi rend="italic">REA</hi> 36 [1934] 525-26; J. and L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">La Carie</hi> , 2: 239 and n. 2; see also Hansen, <hi rend="italic">Attalids</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 176). Of course Robert's claim does not exclude the possibility that an Apollonia named for the god could have been founded by the Attalids.</p>
               <p>There may have been an Antiocheia festival at Apollonia. Christian Habicht informs me that a substantial fragment (nineteen lines) of a decree honoring Andromachos was seen by W. Müller-Wiener in 1960 at Apolyont. It is from the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , was issued by <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00702.gif"/>, and mentions a temple of Apollo and, apparently, a festival, the <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00703.gif"/>. It will be published, from notes by Müller-Wiener and Habicht, by E. Schwertheim.</p>
               <p>Holleaux has suggested that the <hi rend="bold">decree honoring Korrhagos</hi> (<hi rend="italic">SEG</hi> II.663) and dated palaeographically to between 225 and 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> was voted by Apollonia on the Rhyndakos (<hi rend="italic">Ét</hi> ., 2: 114-16; followed by Allen, <hi rend="italic">Attalid Kingdom</hi> , 88 n. 55, who also argues against Magie's preference [1011-13] for Abydos). If the city in question was Apollonia, then the fact that it had a <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00704.gif"/> (l. 10) lends support to the notion that it was an old (i.e., pre-Hellenistic) city. Robert's suggestion</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> 11-12 [1960] 510 n. 2) that the city in the Korrhagos decree might be Miletoupolis is not convincing.</p>
               <p>Silver and bronze <hi rend="bold">coinage</hi> with an inverted anchor and crayfish, dated to the fifth and fourth centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and previously attributed by some scholars to Apollonia on the Rhyndakos (<hi rend="italic">HN</hi> [first edition] 447-48; <hi rend="italic">BMC Mysia</hi> , 8-10, nos. 1-17; see also Hasluck, <hi rend="italic"> Cyzicus</hi> , 71 and n. 3; Hirschfeld, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v.

As with the coinage of other like-named cities in Asia Minor (see APOLLONIA on the Maeander, APOLLONIA Salbake, APOLLONIA in Phrygia) certain coins of the late Hellenistic or Imperial period with the legend A<hi rend="Symbol">P</hi> O<hi rend="Symbol">LLW</hi> NIAT<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N have, over the years, been regrouped with or taken from Apollonia on the Rhyndakos. For example, <hi rend="italic">Inv.

Hasluck suggests the same for another coin grouped with Apollonia Salbake, Mionnet, Suppl. 6: 472, no. 180. For the reattribution of coins of Apollonia Salbake to Apollonia on the Rhyndakos, see also von Fritze, <hi rend="italic">Ant. Münz. Mysiens</hi> , 73ff. On the other hand, J. and L. Robert (<hi rend="italic">La Carie</hi> , 2: 258-59) have pointed out that two coins attributed by von Fritze to Apollonia on the Rhyndakos (<hi rend="italic">Ant. Münz.

               <p>The <hi rend="bold">location</hi> of Apollonia was at the site of the modern Apolyont, which is at the tip of a peninsula jutting into the northwest corner of the Lake of Apolyont (Ululbat Gölü).

                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 150); contra, Magie, 1190. Dörner (32) suggested that a settlement had already existed at the site and that Bithynion was only a renamed town. In this connection one should note the tradition recorded by Pausanias (8.9.7) that Bithynion had originally been settled by Arcadians from Mantineia (on which see Dörner, loc. cit.; Robert, 135ff.; Magie, 1190). Babelon and Reinach (Waddington et al., <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> , 1: 267) commented: "Il n'est pas question de cette ville . . . avant l'époque romaine."</p>

               <p>1 Droysen suggested the identification of Apollodorus' Hellenopolis with that of Stephanos; Hopp, op. cit., was rightly sceptical. Droysen also suggested that the Hella that Stephanos mentions (s.v.) was identical with Hellenopolis. This is also not likely; see Tscherikower, 50; Bürchner, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v.

With regard to Stephanos' placing Hellenopolis in Bithynia it is well to recall Strabo's observation that it is difficult to distinguish the boundaries of Bithynia, Phrygia, and Mysia (12.4.4; see C.

The Antigoneians mentioned in an Eretrian decree (<hi rend="italic">Syll</hi> .<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> 348) who were friends of Demetrios Poliorketes may have come from this city. However, the fact that Demetrios was operating in the Hellespont in 302 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (Diod. 20.111.3) suggests the persons honored were probably from ANTIGONEIA in Mysia or near Daskyleion; see also ALEXANDREIA Troas.</p>
               <p>On the problem surrounding the <hi rend="bold">founding date</hi> see Tscherikower, 47 n. 185; Ruge, 228. We may attempt to reconstruct the chronological sequence as follows: Lysimachos first came into possesssion of Antigoneia Nikaia after the battle of Ipsos in 301 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> By that time, according to Diodorus (20.109.6-7), he had married Amastris, whom he was soon to divorce in favor of Arsinoe (Memnon, <hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 434 F4.9). Assuming Lysimachos did not divorce Nikaia in order to marry Amastris, it may be suggested that Nikaia died in 302 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and that Lysimachos refounded Antigoneia in her memory soon after Ipsos.</p>
               <p>2. Regarding the tradition about a <hi rend="bold">Macedonian origin</hi> , Stephanos (s.v.) says that Nikaia was a colony of Bottiaia, which was in Macedonia. Memnon adds (<hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 434 F28.9-10, on which see Jacoby's commentary) that soldiers from Nikaia in Locris near Phocis who were fighting with Alexander founded it. Presumably this tradition explains the appearance of Alexander on some coins of Imperial Nikaia (e.g., <hi rend="italic">BMC Pontus</hi> , 159, no. 47; Imhoof-Blumer, <hi rend="italic">Kl.M</hi> ., 9, no. 3, and citations there). It is unlikely, however, that veterans of Alexander—who was never in this region—founded a colony here. But it is possible, as Tscherikower suggests (47; see also Ruge, 229), that these Bottiaians were veterans of Antigonos' army. In any event Dio Chrysostom (<hi rend="italic">Or</hi> . 39.1) refers specifically to the Greek and Macedonian composition of its population. Pliny's statement (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.148) that Nikaia was formerly called Olbia is wrong; see NIKOMEDEIA.</p>
               <p>3. <hi rend="bold">Dionysos and Herakles</hi> each appear on some Nikaian coins (first-second century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ) as <hi rend="italic">ktistes</hi> (e.g., Waddington et al., <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> , 1: 403ff., nos. 44, 54-55, 219 [Dionysos], 56-58, 108 [Herakles; cf. Dio Chrys. 39.8: "Herakles the <hi rend="italic">ktistes</hi> of the city"]). Occasionally Dionysos and the nymph Nikaia are associated as <hi rend="italic"> ktistai</hi> (e.g., Waddington et al., <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> , 1: 503, no. 819; Robert, <hi rend="italic">HSCP</hi> [1977] 15).

               <p>1. In a curious passage Strabo ascribes the <hi rend="bold">founding</hi> of Prousa to a mythical Prousias (12.4.3): <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00716.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00717.gif"/>. For Croesus, Stephanos (s.v. "Prousa") substituted Cyrus. Since no such Prousias is known in the sixth or fifth century, these passages have been treated with scepticism or subjected to unconvincing emendations. For example, A. Körte (<hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 24 [1899] 412 n. 1) has suggested there was a half-mythical founder who considerably predated Prousias I. This position has met with little acceptance; see, for example, G. Mendel, <hi rend="italic">BCH</hi> 24 (1900) 363 n. 2; Tscherikower, 48-49; Holleaux, <hi rend="italic">Ét</hi> ., 2: 114 n. 4; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Ét. anat</hi> ., 232 n. 1. Recently T. Corsten has suggested that Prousa was in fact originally founded in the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> by a Bithynian leader named Prous, who fought against Croesus (or with him against Cyrus), and was later refounded by King Prousias I (<hi rend="italic">Tyche</hi> [1989] 33-34). The emendation of Groskurd, cited by Droysen (<hi rend="italic">Hist</hi> ., 2: 704-5) and Kadet (<hi rend="italic">La Lydie</hi> , 221 n. 4 ), is <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00718.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00719.gif"/>. For other suggested emendations and discussion see Dörner, 1077. There are extant <hi rend="bold">Imperial coins of Prousa</hi> with a head of Commodus on the obverse and on the reverse another head with the legend <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00720.gif"/> TON KTI<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> THN <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00721.gif"/> (see Mionnet, 2: 481,</p>
               <pb id="JD_Page_404" n="404"/>
               <p>no. 385; id., Suppl. 5: =26, no. 1335). The identification of the head on the reverse is not certain. Imhoof-Blumer asserted that the portrait is not of Prousias I but rather of the mythical founder (<hi rend="italic">Nomisma</hi> 6 [1911] 9-10; see also Droysen, <hi rend="italic"> Hist</hi> ., 2: 705). Mendel (363 n. 2), however, claimed that the head was "sans doute celle de Prousias." Another coin, of Geta as Augustus, bears the legend TON KTI<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> THN <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00722.gif"/> on the reverse with the representation of a figure (Prousias?) in military uniform (Waddington et al., <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> , 1: 591, no. 116). See further, Leschhorn, 282f.</p>
               <p>The dedicatory inscription <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00723.gif"/>
                  <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00724.gif"/>. published by C. Papadopoulos (<hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> [1865-1866] 374, no. XI) is, in fact, a forgery. See E. Preuner, <hi rend="italic">AM</hi> 46 (1921) 24; L. Robert, <hi rend="italic">REA</hi> 36 (1934) 524; id., <hi rend="italic">RPh</hi> (1939) 137.</p>
               <p>Sölch's suggestion (158f.) that Prousa was the earlier Atussa (Pliny <hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.143) is unconvincing.</p>
               <p>2. On the <hi rend="bold">Bithynian-Attalid was</hi> between Prousias I and Eumenes II see Habicht, <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi> 84 (1956) 90-100.

Magie, who dismissed the idea that Hannibal had anything to do with the founding, dated it arbitrarily to soon after 202 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> (1187). Habicht (<hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v.

The decree would be datable to 187/6 <hi rend="smallcaps"> B.C.</hi> The problem for Robert, of course, is that the decree would thus date to <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the year he prefers for the founding, i.e., 184! On the other hand, if we follow Habicht's founding date of 188 or 187 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> , then the decree would be datable to the period soon after the establishment of the city. Vitucci (61-63) restored the line <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00727.gif"/> to yield a date of 181/0 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>

               <p>According to Memnon (<hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 434 F19 and 32) Prousias I captured Kieros from Heraldeia on the Pontus and renamed it after himself.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The precise founding date is not known.

               <p>The town name appears as <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00745.gif"/> in Ptolemy (5.1.3) and <hi rend="italic">sub Hypio monte</hi> in Pliny (<hi rend="italic">NH</hi> 5.148) but most often as <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00746.gif"/> in inscriptions (e.g., <hi rend="italic"> IGR</hi> I.139.6). On coins—all of which date from the Imperial period—the name <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00747.gif"/> alone is found in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> ; subsequently we find <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00748.gif"/>. Stephanos (s.v.

Nevertheless, confusion between the two Prousiases—on the Hypios and by the Sea—and Prousa was common in private documents. Furthermore in inscriptions the name "Prousias" was often written without any further designation.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> This situation is ameliorated somewhat by the fact that, according to the numismatic evidence, Prousias by the Sea reassumed its original name of Kios from the reign of Claudius.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Thus, after this time the name "Prousias" and its ethnic can normally be attributed to Prousias on the Hypios.</p>
               <p>Kieros was originally founded by Herakleia, itself a colony of Megara. Traces of this connection can be seen in the presence of a magistrate in Roman Prousias with the title of <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00751.gif"/> and the veneration of Herakles as "founder." In fact <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00752.gif"/> was the title of the eponymous magistrate of Megara. Furthermore there was also a tribe named Megaris in Roman Prousias (<hi rend="italic">IGR</hi> III.1422). Other tribes known from the same inscription, which may date from an early phase in the city's history, include Thebais, Dionysios, and Prousias.

               <p>Our only source of information for the settlement of Zeila, Stephanos (s.v. "Zela"), is open to question. He describes it as a polis of Cappadocia founded by Ziaëlas the son of Nikomedes. The location as given by Stephanos must be incorrect because Ziaëlas cannot have controlled territory so far to the southeast of Bithynia. Presumably the town was farther west; where, we do not know.</p>

               <p>Both Stephanos (s.v. "Zipoition") and Memnon (<hi rend="italic">FGrH</hi> 434 F12.5) ascribe the founding of Zipoition to Zipoites. Memnon adds that it was located at the foot of Mount Lypedron. From a dedicatory inscription of Attalos II recording a victory over Prousias I gained at Mount Lypedron (<hi rend="italic">OGIS</hi> 298.3) we may assume that this in fact was the mountain to which Memnon refers.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Neither the precise location of the mountain nor the foundation is known.

Pausanias (5.12.7) says that Nikomedes refounded Astakos as Nikomedeia and that its first founder was Zipoites. On the basis of this and the fact that Zipoites besieged Astakos (Diod. 19.60.3) and Lysimachos destroyed it (Strabo 12.4.2), Jones suggested (<hi rend="italic">CERE</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , 419) that the site of Zipoition was the same as that of the later Nikomedeia. But Pausanias says only that Zipoites founded Nikomedeia. He says nothing about the identification of the two settlements (Waddington et al., <hi rend="italic"> Recueil</hi> , 1: 512 n. 1; Ruge, <hi rend="italic">RE</hi> s.v.

               <p>The thirteen settlements in Asia Minor listed below have been attributed, in antiquity or by modern scholars, to Alexander the Great. Consult the appropriate entries for further discussion and references.</p>

                  <p>AIGEAI. The evidence for Alexander being the founder of Aigeai is found only in a late redaction of the Alexander Romance. A letter in the Romance, purportedly written by the Macedonian king to his mother, relates how he founded Aigeai after the battle of Issos. The letter includes a description of how he used goats with torches on their horns to frighten the Persians into thinking the Macedonian army was large.

In fact two possibilities (Alinda and Herakleia by Latmos) have been sugggested as its location, and four different persons (the Carian queen Ada, Alexander, Lysimachos, and Antigonos Monophthalmos) have been proffered as the founder.

               <p>It will immediately be dear that no settlement in Asia Minor can be unequivocally attributed to Alexander. In some cases the attributions are modern. In other cases the evidence for them is late, dating from the Roman period or even later. Of the thirteen cities, seven—Priene, Alexandreia by Latmos, Amorion, Apollonia in Phrygia, Eukarpeia, Otrous, and Kretopolis—have been championed by modern historians. Three—Chrysopolis, Alexandreia Troas, and Aigeai—are mentioned by late antique or Byzantine writers. Only three—Ilion, Smyrna, and Nikaia—preserve a tradition going back to antiquity, and even in these instances the tradition is hardly secure. Excavation at a number of sites—at Smyrna and Priene, for example—has yielded information for a <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> attribution. In no case, however, is the extant evidence sufficient for firmly assigning any foundation in Asia Minor to Alexander.</p>

               <p>The towns in Asia Minor listed below provide evidence for the presence of Macedonians. The evidence comes in various forms: attestations in the literary sources, Macedonian personal and month names, the Macedonian shield on coins, the ethnic "Macedonian" in an inscription or on a coin. Since it was Macedonians under Alexander and his successors who conquered and colonized the Hellenistic world, evidence for their presence at a particular site is always welcome and potentially useful. Nevertheless one must exercise caution in utilizing this information. The appearance of a single Macedonian name at a site—in the absence of other data—is insufficient to prove the existence of a Macedonian colony. The ethnic "Macedonian" is found on the coins and inscriptions of a number of towns primarily in Lydia and Phrygia. However, one should note that the chronological framework for this evidence is different for each of the two regions. The Lydian evidence dates primarily from the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> The evidence from Phrygia and neighboring regions, on the other hand, first appears in the second and third centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> —long after the period of Hellenistic colonization (see G. M. Cohen, <hi rend="italic"> Anc. Soc</hi> . 22 [1991]41-50).</p>

               <p>The evidence for settlements that were refoundings or renamings of older urban centers is quite extensive. It is clear that the Hellenistic monarchs focused much of their energy on urbanization: on the older cities in Greece, the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and native towns in other parts of Asia Minor. Frequently ancient authors will indicate what the name of the town had been before it was refounded or renamed, or will specify that a particular place had resulted from a synoecism. Similarly inscriptions will occasionally make reference to a <hi rend="italic">synoikismos</hi> . I have noted elsewhere that the term could be used to describe a number of different processes. It could, for example, refer to the political unification of various towns with or without the inhabitants actually moving or the repopulation of a city with former inhabitants who had fled.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the evidence for new settlements is meager. By "new" I mean a foundation built at a previously uninhabited site. And even in these cases the site was often near or adjacent to an older town. The relatively few firm attestations for new foundations undoubtedly reflect the fact that most of the Hellenistic colonies resulted from the refounding or renaming of older settlements. It was obviously less expensive and less burdensome to refound an existing town than to establish a new settlement at a previously uninhabited site. Furthermore one should always bear in mind that the fragmentary nature of the evidence severely restricts our knowledge about the history of many of the colonies.</p>

               <p>Many of the Hellenistic foundations were established as a result of population transfer: the Greek and Macedonian settlers were immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. This fact found later expression in the many colonies that claimed descent from Macedonians, Achaeans, Ionians, Dorians, etc. In addition, for some foundations there are statements or indications that a transfer of population was involved in establishing the new colony. Among these were the following:</p>

               <p>Under the Attalids there was a royal palace at Tralleis.</p>
               <p>Reaching out into the Hellenistic world, SELEUKEIA Tralleis exchanged <hi rend="italic">isopoliteia</hi> with Miletos, ARSINOE in Cilicia did likewise with Nagidos, while the citizens of ANTIOCH Alabanda were given Athenian citizenship (see further, Gawantka, <hi rend="italic"> Isopolitie</hi> ). Both LAODIKEIA on the Lykos and ANTIOCH near Pisidia accepted the invitation of Magnesia on the Maeander to join in celebration of the festival of Artemis Leukophryene.</p>
               <p>Assertions of <hi rend="italic">syngeneia</hi> were not uncommon. ANTIOCH near Pisidia claimed it with Magnesia on the Maeander, and ANTIOCH on the Maeander had a similar relationship with Samos. In the Imperial period Eumeneia in Phrygia minted coins with the legend <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00763.gif"/> AXAI<hi rend="Symbol">W</hi> N and was described as <hi rend="italic">eugenes</hi> . The inhabitants of SYNNADA claimed to be "Ionians" and/or "Dorians," and there probably were Ionians at LAODIKEIA on the Lykos. Farther east, in Cilicia, AIGEAI asserted that it was <hi rend="italic">eugenes</hi> , and claimed <hi rend="italic">syngeneia</hi> with Argos (on <hi rend="italic">eugeneia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> syngeneia</hi> see EUMENEIA, SYNNADA, and AIGEAI and literature cited there).</p>

               <p>Some colonies were organized along military lines. The Seleucid colony at THYATEIRA certainly had a military organization in its early history as did the colonies at MAGNESIA and PALAIMAGNESIA. STRATONIKEIA in Caria had a military organization alongside its civic structure. The nameless Attalid colony of <hi rend="italic">RG</hi> 51 (see PERGAMON) had a military organization, as did the various foundations concentrated in Lydia from which there arc dedicatory or honorific inscriptions made by <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00764.gif"/>: AGATHEIRA, DOIDYE, -ESPOURA, KOBEDYLE, -ALEIA, LASNEDDA. It is possible that some of the other towns in Phrygia and neighboring regions that provide evidence for Macedonians in the Roman period may have originated as military colonies. In addition there were other foundations whose population included soldiers or ex-soldiers. These included the following:</p>

               <p>There are also a number of localities, primarily in Caria, that had soldiers living in or around a city. These soldiers may have been or may have become military colonists. Cities and towns in this category include IASOS, MYLASA, and PENTACHORA. There are other indications that individual soldiers and settlers could receive allotments of land. According to Diodorus (19.25.2) Antigonos Monophthalmos promised to give large allotments to deserters from Eumenes' army. As R. A. Billows suggests, what he promised deserters from Eumenes' army he surely must have given his own officers and men (<hi rend="italic">Antigonos</hi> , 300).</p>

               <p>Ethnics of cities are to be found on coins, in inscriptions, and in the literary evidence. The ethnic for any particular city will rarely be uniform. Minor variations in spelling were quite common. Similarly, abbreviations on coins take many forms. The appended list is not exhaustive. It gives the main ethnics attested for the cities listed in this book.</p>
               <p>A note about Stephanos of Byzantion: in his appropriately named <hi rend="italic">Ethnika</hi> Stephanos gives the ethnics of cities. Unfortunately his information is not always correct. For example, under "Attaleia" he lists two cities, one in Lydia and one in Cilicia. He then gives the ethnic for both as <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00765.gif"/>. There are two problems: the Attaleia Stephanos lists in Cilicia was actually in Pamphylia (see my discussion, s.v. ATTALEIA in Pamphylia). According to the epigraphic and numismatic evidence the ethnic for the Lydian city was ATTA<hi rend="Symbol">L</hi> EATH<hi rend="Symbol">S</hi> and for the Pamphylian city, <figure rend="inline" entity="ft9w1009ss_00766.gif"/>. As a result, where I have made use of Stephanos' information, I have placed an asterisk next to those ethnics for which he is our sole source of information.</p>
